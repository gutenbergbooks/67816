THE HIGHLAND SOCIETY OF SCOTLAND.</h2>
</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> respectfully dedicating this little Work to the
<span class="smcap">Highland Society of Scotland</span>, the Translator hopes,
that, under their efficient and enlightened patronage, it may
be made generally known in Scotland, where the system
which it explains is calculated to be as extensively applicable,
and as highly profitable, as it has proved in the native mountains
of its amiable and venerable Author. It seems, indeed,
both from the plain practical directions which it contains,
and the valuable discoveries which it communicates relative
to the history and economy of bees, to be singularly
adapted to forward the views of the Society, who have this
year turned their attention to the encouragement of Apiaries
among the peasantry of our own country; and it is no small
advantage, that the rules laid down are applicable to hives
of every form.</p>

<p>The Translator has no fear of its being objected, that
plans which are very suitable in Switzerland, may be less
successful as applied to Scotland. Switzerland and Scotland
present so many points of resemblance&mdash;in their mountains&mdash;in
their valleys&mdash;and in their climate&mdash;that which is beneficial
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</span>
in the one, can scarcely fail to be so in the other.
And as the Swiss honey is known to be not only very abundant,
but of a very superior flavour, especially in those districts
where <span class="smcap">De Gelieu's</span> or some similar plan is adopted,
the Translator is desirous to see the simple and successful
methods of that country transferred to our own, that the
Scottish peasantry may derive from their practice the same
advantages. To the Swiss peasantry, bees are a great
source of wealth; a stranger is attracted by the appearance
of substantial comfort, conveyed by well appointed apiaries,
where the hives are ranged in double and triple rows along
the sunny side, and under the shelter of the projecting roofs
of the cottages; and in Scotland there is little doubt that, if
similar care were bestowed on the cultivation of bees, they
would be equally profitable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> attained old age, I think it a duty,
before quitting the world, to communicate to
the public the observations I have made during
sixty-four years that I have been occupied with
bees. From my earliest years I have been very
fond of these admirable insects. I began to observe
them under the direction of my father,
<span class="smcap">Jacques de Gelieu</span>, pastor of the church of
Bayards, and afterwards of that of Verrieres, in
the principality of Neuchatel. He instructed me
in the principles of this interesting study, and
taught me to like and to admire it, by making
me read the memoirs of the immortal <span class="smcap">Reaumur</span>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">- 2 -</span>
with whom he had the honour to correspond.
Being a nice observer, he had prepared, so early
as 1746, a work in two volumes, entitled "A
New and Economical Method for the Preservation
and Increase of Bees, and how to procure a
more abundant supply of Honey and Wax." But
when his work was ready for the press, he lost
in one day, by an unfortunate accident, the whole
of his hives except one, which he presented to
me, and which I subsequently managed under
his direction.</p>

<p>Thrown from that time into a succession of
pressing occupations, he lost sight of the printing
of his work, which is now in my possession,
in his own handwriting. It contains the description
of the storied hive, of which he was the inventor,
and which has since been so variously
modified. These hives have been made known
only through his correspondence with M. <span class="smcap">de
Reaumur</span>, and other literary men, as will appear
from the note at the end of this Preface.</p>

<p>In the collection of observations which I now
present to the public, I limit myself to what is
strictly practical, leaving to superior minds, the
<span class="smcap">Swammerdams</span>, the <span class="smcap">Reaumurs</span>, the <span class="smcap">Shirachs</span>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">- 3 -</span>
the <span class="smcap">Hubers</span>, to dive into the theory with which
they are so successfully engaged.</p>

<p>Theory, however, leads to practice; and I have
built on the foundation which they have so skilfully
laid down. I shall make known what my
long experience has taught me to consider the
best form of hives. To ascertain which merited
the preference, I mixed all sizes and shapes of
them in my apiary, noting down their condition
and product, thus securing a result to which no
doubt could attach; convinced that it is easier to
multiply hives in good seasons than to preserve
them in bad ones, since, in the first case, one has
only to leave them in some measure to themselves,
while in the second there must be assiduous care
and attention bestowed on them. Vexed at hearing
of the great losses that have so generally taken
place of late years, and of the sensible and rapid
diminution of these precious insects, I shall point
out how I succeeded in preserving mine in the
worst seasons, especially in those of 1812 and
1813; and I shall lay down the principles from
which no one should swerve, if he wishes to be
constantly successful.</p>

<p>Many people are fond of bees&mdash;indeed have a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">- 4 -</span>
passion for them; but it is not enough to be fond
of them,&mdash;they must be skilfully taken care of, according
to certain rules, applicable in every case,
but more particularly in bad years. Mistaken
care annoys them&mdash;niggardliness ruins them. In
laying down rules, I shall always take care to assign
my reasons for them.</p>

<p>Among the discoveries which I had the happiness
to make, there is one of the greatest importance
to the practical apiarian, of which I had
not even the slightest suspicion, and which astonished
me so much that I could not believe my
eyes. It was only after trials a hundred times
repeated and diversified, that I could fully convince
myself. The fact is certain, the reason is
to me unknown, and I leave to persons more
learned than myself to give the explanation.</p>

<p>I have read most of the treatises that have been
published on bees, and have found errors in most
of them. To avoid them myself, I shall advance
nothing that I have not verified by numerous experiments,
which every one may repeat. I shall
make my narrative as short as possible.</p>

<p>I have said that the storied hives invented by
my late father, were known only through his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">- 5 -</span>
correspondence with M. <span class="smcap">de Reaumur</span>, and other
literary men; the following is the proof:</p>

<p>Extract from the <i>Corps d'Observation of the Society
of Commerce and Agriculture of Great Britain</i>,
1757-58. Printed at Rennes in 1761, page
162.</p>

<p>"Monsieur de la <i>Bourdonaye, Procureur General-Syndic</i>,
to whom the custom of our peasants
(of drowning the bees, or suffocating them with
sulphur, in order to deprive them of all the store
they have laid up to maintain them during the
winter) has been long known, wrote to M. <span class="smcap">de
Reaumur</span>, during the last assembly of the states,
1756, to ask for some instructions on this subject.</p>

<p>"This academician pointed out, in his answer,
the methods which he had expounded in the fifth
volume <i>des Memoires pour servir &agrave; l'Histoire Naturelle
des Insectes</i>; but he recommends, more particularly,
to use the curiously shaped hives, invented
by <span class="smcap">Gelieu</span>, a gentleman of the principality
of Neuchatel.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Reaumur's</span> letter, which, at first sight,
seems to contain a sufficient description of <span class="smcap">Gelieu's</span>
hive, does not clear up certain difficulties
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">- 6 -</span>
that presented themselves in the detail, when we
come to attempt their construction from his directions;
and therefore <span class="smcap">Nevel</span>, member of the
Committee of Rennes, resolved to request a pattern
hive from <span class="smcap">Reaumur</span> himself, which he accordingly
obtained, and sent to the society. It
appears that hives of this kind would supply all
that can be desired in the management of bees;
but they would cost more than one louis each&mdash;a
price infinitely beyond the reach of a labouring
man, and which would even be too great for the
rich. It was necessary, therefore, to think of
profiting by the invention of <span class="smcap">Gelieu</span>, in contriving
hives so cheap that every peasant might use
them.</p>

<p>"Monsieur <span class="smcap">de la Bourdonaye</span>, who paid
great attention to this subject, kindly communicated
to the Society both the letter of <span class="smcap">Reaumur</span>,
and the plan which he himself had formed,
of making hives at a small expence. He
began by using, on his own estate, those which
he recommended as an experiment to the Society.
It was called an <i>experiment</i>, because, in reality,
notwithstanding the probability of success attending
the use of hives like those of which he sent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">- 7 -</span>
the model, his modesty made him afraid that
experience might, in some shape, belie his hopes.
The Society was not long in ordering hives to be
made after the model. They have made trial of
them in the different faubourgs of Rennes. The
rainy summer has prevented these trials being
completed, but the commencement has succeeded
very well.</p>

<p>"It is perhaps not altogether useless to give
here an abridged exposition of the accidents that
might be prevented, in changing the shape of
ordinary hives, and of the means that might be
employed for that purpose.</p>

<p>"It has been already said, that it is but too
common to suffocate or drown the bees, at the
end of the season, for the sake of profiting by the
honey and wax. Those who manage them with
more profit and intelligence, watch the time when
the hives are nearly full, to force the bees up into
an empty hive. This operation must be done
in fine weather, in order that the bees may have
time to make a sufficient provision for the winter.
This practice, though the best of those in
use at present, causes considerable loss; the
brood-comb is taken away with the wax; so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">- 8 -</span>
that the proprietor loses a swarm just coming
out, as well as the swarms that this one might
have afterwards produced. It is this loss particularly
that <span class="smcap">Gelieu</span> would prevent.</p>

<p>"The hives at present on trial are, in shape,
like a little round tower, or hollow cylinder, composed
of four equal pieces, placed one above another."</p>

<p>"It is a certain fact, that the cells destined for
the reception of eggs are always situated in the
lower part of the hive, which is never disturbed.
According to <span class="smcap">Gelieu's</span> plan, it is only the storey
above the hive that is taken, until after the brood-comb
has furnished a swarm, and the swarm has
taken flight.</p>

<p>"It seems, then, the interest of Rennes to patronize
<span class="smcap">Gelieu's</span> hives; they guard against the
inconveniences of the methods now in use; and
this has induced <span class="smcap">Bourdonaye</span> to adopt the means
of making them of straw, in place of wood, like
those of <span class="smcap">Gelieu</span>.</p>

<p>"Monsieur <span class="smcap">de la Bourdonaye's</span> hives are a
little higher priced than those in common use;
but they give nearly a quarter more room, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">- 9 -</span>
are, of course, more profitable in regard to price;
they are in the proportion of five to eight.</p>

<p>"We shall soon be able to determine, with
certainty, the advantages to be derived from this
invention. <span class="smcap">Montluc</span> has placed some joinings,
such as <span class="smcap">Bourdonaye</span> has contrived, underneath
his own hives, upon his estate of Laille. Similar
ones, at different places in the faubourgs of
Rennes, will furnish decided proofs of comparison.</p>

<p>"The preservation, and also the increase of
bees, is an object of such interest to Brittany,
that the peasants cannot be too much encouraged
to turn their attention to it.</p>

<p>"The Society is well aware that it will be
necessary to publish general instructions on that
head, and that the greatest merit of such a work
will be to give <i>only necessary</i> instructions, and
nothing more. It must be made so simple and
so cheap as to be within every one's reach, and,
above all, applicable only to practical use. Any
thing more is only fit for treatises wherein the
authors are more occupied with the interests of
their own self love, than with those of the public.
But though much has been written on this subject,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">- 10 -</span>
the Society is of opinion that there are yet
observations and experiments to be made before
publishing a document by which all the world
might profit."</p>

<p>On this long quotation, I shall merely take
the liberty of remarking, that the only inconvenience
ascribed to the storied hives, invented
and made by my Father&mdash;the only objection
made to them&mdash;is, that they are too dear, "that
they will cost more than a louis each; a price
infinitely beyond the reach of a labouring man."
The price is high in Brittany, where wood is
very dear. On the other hand, the model which
my Father sent to <span class="smcap">Reaumur</span>, was made with a
great deal of nicety, as a common one would not
have been worth offering to that illustrious academician
who sent him in return a very handsome
thermometer, graduated by himself. My Father's
hives, more simply wrought, were less expensive.</p>

<span class="smaller">SITUATION OF AN APIARY.</span>
</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> choice of a good situation is of the utmost
consequence. An apiary will not thrive in a bad
situation, however well it may be cared for in
other respects.</p>

<p>1. The hives must, above all things, be sheltered
from the wind. It is the first precept of
Virgil<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>. For that purpose, the force of the
wind must be broken, either by houses or by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">- 12 -</span>
lofty trees in the vicinity. A wall, however high,
or a simple hedge, is not sufficient, because the
bees that fly to the fields prefer stopping in places
where the air is tranquil, near bushes, or along
hedges or dells, where they find a much greater
abundance of honey than in places exposed to
gales of wind. They fatigue themselves flying
from flower to flower, and still more returning
to their dwelling, after having completed their
little ladenings: with a rapid flight they get over
a great extent of space, frequently against the
wind; but, on approaching their hive, they
slacken their speed, and advance, wheeling round
and round, to recognize it. A mistake, at this
time, might be fatal, and cost them their lives;
and if, at this moment, they encounter a strong
current of air, or a whirlwind, to repel them,
they are again forced to wheel round to reconnoitre
their habitation. After a hard struggle,
the most vigorous arrive; the others fall, without
power to rise again, especially when the air is
cold, or the sky clouded. The ground will then
be strewed with dying or dead bees, which never
happens when the hives are placed in sheltered
situations.</p>

<p>2<i>d</i>, The second condition of a good situation
is its proximity to a fountain; or, still better, to
a little brook, where the bees may drink<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>. Water
is absolutely necessary, and enters as much
as honey into the composition of the pap with
which they nourish the brood; and the pollen
or dust of flowers, which they bring home on
their thighs, is also a very essential ingredient
in this pap. The vicinity of deep waters is very
hurtful to bees; and I have sometimes seen hundreds
of them drowned attempting to drink out
of a cistern.</p>

<p>If there is no small stream or fountain near
them, they should be supplied by troughs, filled
with moss, and then water poured on it, until
they are as full as they can hold. The working
bees come in swarms to them in the spring, and
quench their thirst without risk.</p>

<p>3<i>d</i>, It is commonly believed that an apiary is
not well situated unless it stands in the sun.
This is an error; bees like the shade when working,
and like the sun only when in the fields,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">- 14 -</span>
which then animates and sustains them. For
this reason, when people wish a swarm to settle,
after it has left the hive, they hasten to cover it;
because the shade induces them to rest, while a
hot sun annoys them, and inclines them to take
flight again. When we wish to disperse a cluster
of bees off the front of a hive, we have only
to expose it to the rays of the sun in the heat of
the day. The bees then retreat under the hive,
on the side, or behind it. They thrive well in
thick forests, and delight in them; because there
they find a uniform temperature and a propitious
shade. How often, during the dog-days, have
we not seen the honey running down, and the
combs melting, in those hives exposed to the heat
of the sun. In one hour, sometimes, a whole
apiary will be destroyed. It is also a mistake
to suppose hives exposed to the sun produce the
earliest and strongest swarms. I have oftener
than once experienced the reverse. My earliest
swarms have generally come from the best shaded
hives, and which only receive the sun late.
I have even lost some in such situations, because
they took flight sooner than we thought of watching
them. We need never fear to shade a hive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">- 15 -</span>
since Virgil recommends it<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>. If the roof does
not project sufficiently to protect the hive from
the sun in the heat of the day, I would advise
them to be shaded with deals or pieces of matting.</p>

where the sun is from ten o'clock till mid-day.
They should never be turned to the east or west,

them.</p>

<span class="smaller">PROPER TIME TO TRANSPORT A SWARM TO THE
SITUATION DESIGNED FOR IT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Most</span> people who have bees allow their swarms
to remain till the evening in the place where
they have alighted, and do not move them to the
apiary till after sunset. This method has many
inconveniences, which have been already pointed
out by a most judicious and experienced author.
As soon as a swarm has congregated in the new
hive, and seems to be at ease in it, the most industrious
among the bees fly off to the fields, but
with a great many precautions. They descend
the front of the hive, and turn to every side, to
examine it thoroughly; then take flight, and
make some circles in the air, in order to reconnoitre
their new abode: they do the same in returning.</p>

<p>If the swarm has taken flight in the morning,
the same bees make several excursions during
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">- 17 -</span>
the day, and each time with less precaution, as,
becoming familiarized with their dwelling, they
are less afraid of mistaking it; and thus, next
morning, supposing themselves in the same place,
they take wing without having observed where
they have spent the night, and surprised, at their
return, not to find the hive in the same place, they
fly about all day in search of it, until they perish
with fatigue and despair. Thus, many hundreds
of the most industrious labourers are lost, and
this may be entirely avoided, if the swarm be removed
as soon as the bees are perceived coming
out, with the precautions I have mentioned. This
sign alone is sufficient. Sometimes I do not
even wait until all the bees clustered in front,
or on the sides of the hive, are re-united to their
companions in the interior, as they are never
long in being so; and this plan has always fully
succeeded with me.</p>

<span class="smaller">SITUATION OF THE HIVES OUGHT NEVER TO BE CHANGED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> seen people shift about their hives very
inconsiderately, but change of place invariably
weakens them, as the bees will return to their
old residence, the environs of which are so familiar
to them. A hive should remain as fixed to
the spot as the ancient oaks, in the hollows of
which they delight to establish themselves,&mdash;where
they have their young, their companions,
their beloved queen, and all their treasures.
When the young bees take wing for the first time,
they do it with great precaution, turning round
and round, and fluttering about the entrance, to
examine the hive well before taking flight. They
do the same in returning, so that they may be
easily distinguished, conducting themselves nearly
after the same maimer as the workers of a
newly hived swarm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">- 19 -</span></p>

<p>When they have made a few hundred excursions,
they set off without examining the locality,
and, returning in full flight, will know their own
hive in the midst of a hundred others. But if
you change its place you perplex them, much
the same as you would be if, during a short absence,
some one lifted your house and placed it
a mile off. The poor bees return loaded, and,
seeking in vain for their habitation, either fall
down and perish with fatigue, or throw themselves
into the neighbouring hives, where they
are speedily put to death.</p>

<p>The following fact proves how much these
precious insects are attached to place, and how
far they retain the recollection of it.</p>

<p>During my residence at Lignieres, where I
passed twenty-seven years, I removed all my
hives into the house towards the middle of November,
to guard them from the drifted snow,
in which my apiary would sometimes be buried,
and I replaced them again some fine day in March.
Having hives of wood and straw, of different
sizes and shapes, I arranged them with more order
and symmetry, and, with this view, I placed
the first on the opposite side of the apiary to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">- 20 -</span>
where it formerly stood. Although it had been
shut up nearly four months, the bees returned
to the same place they had occupied the year
before, which obliged me to return my hive with
all speed, and led me to conclude that they
should not be moved about, and that the bees
will not be pliable to our fancies and caprices.</p>

<p>When hives are transported to a considerable
distance, there is no fear that the bees will return.
But this inconvenience would be sure to
take place, and many of the working bees would
perish, if they were removed only a few hundred
paces from the spot they have been accustomed
to. The hive may not perish, but it will be
greatly weakened. In my opinion, if the situation
is to be changed at all, they should be removed
at least a mile and a half.</p>

<span class="smaller">MOST CONVENIENT SHAPE OF HIVES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the chief objects of my researches has
been, to ascertain what shape of hive is the most
profitable; and, with this view, I have tried
all the different kinds in my apiary, and I have
invariably remarked, that bees thrive better in
low hives than in high ones; that, in general,
those which are broad and flat, or extended horizontally,
amass more honey, thrive better, and
give out stronger and earlier swarms, than those
which are high, and of several stories, and for
the following reasons.</p>

<p>A hive thrives only in proportion to the success
or perfection of its brood-comb. If the spring
eggs come out well, the hive will stock, give out
swarms at the proper time, and collect a great
deal of honey, because the strength of its population
will enable it to take advantage of fine
days; while a weak hive will only give out late
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">- 22 -</span>
swarms; and, having few labourers, will gather
very little honey. It is, therefore, of great importance
to assist the hive as much as possible,
in the spring especially, when it is of itself too
weak to keep up the necessary degree of heat
for the hatching of the brood; and also, that
in our climate there are frequently storms of
frost and snow at that season, which are very
prejudicial to it. If at that time the bees are
lodged in high and roomy hives, they will crowd
together in vain to procure the necessary degree
of heat to vivify the brood-comb, which is always
deposited in the middle of the hive, and the heat
ascending is dissipated and lost in the empty
space above. I have seen whole combs full of
eggs do no good, in consequence of the want of
heat. This never happens in the low, flat hives,
where the heat is more easily concentrated; here,
as the young bees come to life, the heat augments,
and they assist in taking care of the
others that are advancing, and begin to spread
out on all sides, and entirely to fill the hive: the
republic prospers, and increasing numbers are
distinguished.</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, for this reason that bees thrive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">- 23 -</span>
well in conical or sugar-loaf shaped hives, which
are common in some countries: but they have
this disadvantage, that <i>capes</i> cannot be so easily
fitted to them, which facilitate the collecting of
the finest honey, and of which I shall treat presently.</p>

<span class="smaller">HIVES OF STRAW AND WOOD.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>It is commonly supposed that bees thrive best
in straw hives, because the straw absorbs the
moisture, and the combs are less liable to mould.
For my part, I can perceive no difference. The
bees are careful enough to varnish over the interior
of the straw hives with a coating of wax, or
rather <i>propolis</i>, to prevent the settlement of the
moths; and, in the old hives, this varnish is so
thick that no moisture can penetrate between the
cords of the straw. Wooden hives will also absorb
moisture, to a certain extent; and experience
has shewn me, that it is a matter of indifference
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">- 24 -</span>
which are employed, except as to the price, according
as either material may be more or less
abundant in different parts of the country.</p>

<span class="smaller">THICKNESS OR SOLIDITY OF HIVES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Whatever</span> may be the form or material of
which hives are made, I strongly recommend not
to be sparing of it, but to make them substantial.
I would recommend that the boards of
the wooden ones be an inch and a half thick;
and that the straw-ropes of which the others
are composed, be well twisted, and more than
an inch in diameter. Such hives will be heavier
and more unwieldy than thin hives, but
they afford a better protection from the sun in
summer, and the frost in winter. The heat
of the sun is apt to melt the combs in summer:
in winter the cold sometimes candies, and
renders them useless; and, in the spring, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">- 25 -</span>
thin hives neither retain the heat necessary for
hatching the eggs, nor for preserving the honey in
a liquid state. One may easily be convinced of
this, by laying some folds of linen on the top of
the hive, and then passing the hand between
them, and there will be a degree of warmth felt,
which never happens where the hives are thick
enough. They may be a little more costly, but
the expence is more than compensated by the
prosperity of the bees.</p>

<span class="smaller">SIZE OF THE APERTURE OR ENTRANCE OF HIVES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is of great importance to widen or contract
the entrance, according to the season, or to the
strength of the swarms; and for this purpose it
is only necessary to have a few little wedges, or
bits of wood, that may be taken out or put in at
pleasure. Hives are weak in spring, because the
bees are engaged in the interior, keeping warm,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">- 26 -</span>
and taking care of the young, and the guard at
the door is not strong enough to prevent invaders.
Contract the door, therefore, and four bees will
defend it better than thirty would do, if it were
more spacious, and enlarge it again by degrees,
according to the increase of the population. The
working bees must have room enough to go out
and in without hindrance; when they begin to
crowd together in groups at the entrance, it is
a sign of the interior being filled, and they
should then have free access, as they will be
strong enough to resist pillage. When the
cluster becomes very large, which it will do as
the drones increase, enlarge the entrance as much
as possible. It is even advisable sometimes to open
the hive a little at the top, in order to moderate,
by a current of air, the excessive heat that forces
the bees to the outside; and this is the only case
in which there is any advantage in lofty hives.
After the destruction of the drones, the population
diminishes, and the bees no longer cluster
outside, and then is the time to begin, by degrees,
to contract the entrance, in order to prevent
plunder.</p>

<p>For this purpose, I use little wooden wedges
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">- 27 -</span>
first, because they cost nothing, as any body may
make them with a knife and a bit of stick; and,
secondly, because they help to protect them from
the moths, which make sad havoc when once
they gain access to a hive. They deposit their
eggs in the interstices between the wedges and
the hives, and they are hatched by the heated
vapour that is expelled by the constant vibration
of the wings of the bees. In the fine weather of
April or May, I inspect my hives twice or three
times a-week, before the bees go out in the
morning, take out the wedges, and scrape and
clean them with my knife; and, in this way, I
protect them from the moths.</p>

them. How many people follow blindly the

wherefore; others go on by chance, without rule

depriving them of too much of their honey; at
another, they suffer whole colonies to die of hunger,
when they might save them by giving them
food; and, in autumn, they suffocate those that
appear to be destitute of provisions, because they
know not how or in what manner to preserve
them. Few amateurs understand thoroughly the
state and wants of their hives, and generally estimate
them by lifting them up to feel their

mistakes, some being three or four times
heavier than others, it is of the utmost importance
to know the exact weight of each hive,
when empty, without either combs or bees. For

<span class="smaller">QUANTITY OF HONEY NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN A HIVE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> quantity varies according to the climate.
In southern countries, where there is scarcely
any winter, the bees gather food till towards the
end of autumn, and the flowers offer them pasture
again very early in the spring. In these
countries, therefore, they require a smaller winter
store than in colder climates. The directions
I am about to give, are only applicable to
Switzerland, or to those countries which nearly
resemble it in point of temperature. Every hive
ought to have at least three pots of honey to
nourish it during the winter; and, as the pot of
honey, Neuchatel measure, weighs rather more
than five pounds, of seventeen ounces to the
pound, there should be fully fifteen pounds of
honey allowed to each hive. Whether the swarm
be strong or weak, large or small, is of no consequence,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">- 30 -</span>
as the smallest swarm will consume as
much as a large one. If they have less than that
allowance, they may linger through the winter,
but will be sure to die if the spring happens to
be a late one, and the weather cold and rainy.
If a hive is expected to swarm, it should be allowed
a quarter more in the autumn, that is,
twenty pounds of honey: or it may be supplied
after another manner, which I shall point out.
But let there be no higgling with bees; better
that they have too much than too little: more
prudent than man, they never waste or abuse
their superfluity.</p>

<p>In estimating the quantity of provisions that a
hive contains, its age should be considered; and
it is to be taken into account, that the black
combs of old hives weigh ten times more than
the white combs of a young one. It becomes,
therefore, a matter of importance to know the
weight of the empty hive, without which the
quantity of provision cannot be estimated, and
to weigh it again at the end of the honey season.
When a swarm of the present year, at the
end of autumn, weighs fifteen or sixteen pounds
more than its original weight, I take nothing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">- 31 -</span>
from it, and I give it nothing, being certain that
it can maintain itself, if not plundered. If it
has twenty-five, or even thirty pounds, neither
do I touch it, as it will prosper so much the better
next year. As to old hives, they ought, at
the beginning of winter, to weigh twenty-five
pounds above their original weight. I willingly
leave them thirty or thirty-six pounds. The remainder
I consider my own, and of course take
it away.</p>

<p>Some people will wonder at the quantity of
provisions which I leave to my hives; but it is
the true means, I may say the true secret, by
which to insure swarms, for a starved one never
produces. To this I have seen only one exception.
I lavished honey upon a hive in spring,
when it was crowded with bees, which were in
want; this enabled it to give out a late swarm,
but it never prospered. What surplus I bestow
upon them, I consider as not lost, and that,
sooner or later, it will return to me. Besides,
the consumption is prodigious during the great
<i>hatching</i> in the months of March, April, and
May. It requires an incredible quantity to nourish
the young in the state of <i>larv&aelig;</i> or worms.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">- 32 -</span>
The larv&aelig; are involved in a kind of pap, which
its nurses lavish upon it, and which is chiefly
composed of honey. If, at this time, there should
happen to be whole weeks of cold rainy weather,
and high winds, which is sometimes the case at
that season, the poor bees, unable to get to the
fields, will suffer severely if they have not honey
in store; the hatching is interrupted till the return
of fine weather; and the population makes
no progress: while, in well provisioned hives, it
goes on without intermission. Bees are very saving;
but it is to our profit. Let us not deal
grudgingly with them.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it is not advantageous to leave
them greatly too much honey,&mdash;excessive super-abundance
annoys them. In plentiful seasons, I
have seen middling sized straw-hives in which
the combs were filled with honey down to the
very boards. This happens especially when the
bees have enriched themselves with plunder in
the autumn; and there are two inconveniences
attending it; first, the bees have not room to deposit
their brood, which, by the time the swarms
are ready to go off, fills the hive almost entirely;
secondly, the old honey candies, and, in that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">- 33 -</span>
state, it is of no use to the bees. When hives are
to be renewed by the cutting out of old combs,
it is this kind that should, above all, be taken
away. It is always to be found in old hives;
and if it has been left several winters in the
hive, it sours and contracts a disagreeable taste.
The best use that can then be made of it is to
dissolve it with more or less wine, and feed the
bees with it on the approach of the swarming
season; above all, when the weather is cold and
rainy. Their activity is then increased by it.</p>

<p>These succours will not be found superfluous
even when the trees are in flower. In fine weather
they find honey in abundance on them; but,
should a few rainy days interrupt their labours,
and throw them upon their own resources, the
progress of the hatching is stopped, and injury is
done to all.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE USE OF CAPES OR HOODS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Well</span> made straw-hives ought to have a hole
in the top, of about an inch or an inch and a
half in diameter, which may be closed with a
cork or stopper of wood. This stopper may be
drawn out when it is found advisable to put a
cape or hood on it, so as to give the bees more
room to deposit their honey. These capes are
little straw-hives capable of containing five or
six pounds of honey-comb, or more, according
to the size of the hive on which they are placed.
They are made very thin and light: the cords of
straw of which they are formed are very small,
being not intended to keep in the heat, but merely
to serve as a temporary magazine for the honey.</p>

<p>The use of these additions will be easily understood
by those who know that it takes as long
a time to hatch a bee as to hatch a chicken, viz.
three weeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">- 35 -</span></p>

<p>I have already said and repeated, that, in the
swarming season, the strong and well provisioned
hives are almost entirely filled with the
brood-comb, and that scarcely any of the cells
will be found empty. At that time also, honey
becomes abundant; and, when fine days succeed
each other, the working bees amass an astonishing
quantity; but where is it to be stored? Moments
are precious. Must they wait until the
young bees have left the brood-cells, a week or
perhaps a fortnight longer, by which time the
early flowers will be cut down or withered, never
more to display their honied cups to these
little reapers? What is to be done in this dilemma?
Must the young be sacrificed, and torn
from the cells, in order to make room for the
riches that nature offers on every hand? But
this destruction of its posterity would ruin the
colony. Mark, then, the resource of the industrious
bees. They search in their neighbourhood
for a place where they may deposit their honey
until the young shall have left the comb in which
they were hatched, and nourished, and undergone
their metamorphoses; and, if they fail in
their object, they crowd together op the front or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">- 36 -</span>
sides of their habitation, forming prodigious
clusters. It is not uncommon to see them build
combs on the outside; many did so in the year
1791, the finest honey year I have seen since
1753. In the year 1791, I drew from one of
my straw-hives that did not swarm, seventy-two
pounds of beautiful honey-comb, merely by emptying
the capes as they were filled. All years,
however, are not like that, nor any thing approaching
to it. There are middling seasons,
when the bees find little more than merely what
is requisite for their own supply. There are also
bad seasons, when almost all the swarms
perish, as well as numberless old hives, when
they do not receive assistance: such, among
others, were the years 1812 and 1813. In the
worst years there are days and even weeks of
fine weather, when the honey is abundant; but
it is of short continuance. The bees, however,
at that time, will deposit their honey into the
capes; and, towards the end of summer, or beginning
of autumn, when little or no more is to
be found, they remove it into the hive, filling
the cells which the brood occupied at the time
it was collected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">- 37 -</span></p>

<p>If, during the summer, we deprive them of
this treasure, which is only deposited in the
capes for the time, we impoverish them, unless
it is returned to them in twice the quantity.
This was one cause of the ruin and depopulation
of so many apiaries during these two fatal
years, and my principal motive for taking up
my pen is, to prevent, if possible, the recurrence
of such disasters, by making known to the public
my observations and discoveries.</p>

<p>If the bees have room enough in the interior
to dispose of their honey, it is needless to give
them capes, for they will not build in them.
These capes are commonly placed on the top of
the hive, but it is matter of indifference whether
they be on the right, on the left, or even underneath,
provided there be an accessible way of
communication between them. If we wish to
attach them to the bottom of the hive, we establish
a communication between the hive and the
cape, by making a hole in the board on which
the hive rests, so as to afford a free passage to
the workers. I have capes of all kinds, above,
below, and on the sides, which all succeed equally
well. Those placed above have an advantage
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">- 38 -</span>
not to be despised, which is, that they prevent
the combs from moulding during the winter, an
evil to which hives are liable in those countries
where they are taken into the house, to protect
them from the frost and snow.</p>

<p>All those that are well stocked, produce a
moisture which, having no vent, collects in drops
on the sides, and at the base of the hive, in which
the bees are kept close prisoners until the return
of fine weather. Many perish during their
long captivity, and, oftener than once, I have
found large icicles in strong hives. This never
happens to those that have capes on the top: the
moisture ascending evaporates through the opening,
as by a chimney; and then one has the satisfaction
of finding the combs healthy and free
of mould in the spring. Care, however, must
be had to cement it all round with clay or mortar,
or some composition suited to exclude the
wind, and to prevent the bees, sometimes very
impatient, from getting out during the winter.</p>

<p>With this precaution, very few will be found
dead in the spring; and, in well-stocked hives,
the laying of eggs begins about the end of January
or beginning of February.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">- 39 -</span></p>

<p>Capes may be adapted to wooden hives, or to
those of any other material, as well as to those
of straw.</p>

<p>Many people place capes over all their swarms
the very day, or the day after, their emigration,
and I approve of this plan for early and strong
swarms.</p>

<p>Capes neither prevent nor retard the issuing
of swarms. I have frequently had hives that filled
them, or were in the way of doing so, when
the emigration took place, but on their numbers
being diminished, stopped the work, and returned
to it again as soon as they were reinforced,
provided they did not give out a second swarm.
Hives that have capes rarely give out second
swarms, and this is no loss.</p>

<p>The honey obtained by the capes is very pure,
beautifully white, and very superior to what is
obtained by the cutting out of combs.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens, that the queen will ascend
into the cape to deposit her eggs, when she
has not room in the interior; therefore, should
any brood-comb happen to be in it when it is intended
to be removed, let it be replaced until
such time as the young are completely hatched.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">- 40 -</span>
The brood-comb is easily distinguished: the cells
that contain it have their covers darker, more
raised, and much thicker, than those that contain
honey, the covers of which are white, flat,
and very thin.</p>

<p>There is no fixed rule for the time of removing
the capes; it must altogether depend on the
abundance of the honey. In six years, there are
usually two bad, two good, and two middling
seasons.</p>

<p>In bad seasons there is nothing to take away;
on the contrary, some must be given, or, properly
speaking, be <i>lent</i> to them, for the industrious
bees always repay three, four, and five fold
interest on the advances that are made them.</p>

<p>In good years, the capes may be emptied three
or four times; and unless this be done the bees
will build their combs on the outside.</p>

<p>In middling seasons, strong and well provisioned
hives fill at least one cape, which may be
taken without remorse, if they have not swarmed.
I seldom or never take any from those that have
swarmed, because they are thereby very much
weakened. Good sense must here direct the proprietor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">- 41 -</span></p>

<p>The only fixed rule which can be laid down
is, never to take the capes that are not quite filled,
unless the hive happens to be very large, as
there is always abundance of honey when the
labourers determine to go to work in the capes.
But beware of taking half-filled capes from small
or middling sized hives: restitution will repair
but a small portion of the evil this will do them.</p>

<span class="smaller">HOW TO EXPEL THE BEES FROM THE CAPES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is in the heat of the day that the honey
should be taken from the capes. A number of
bees will always be found (commissioned no
doubt) to guard the treasure.</p>

<p>Various methods are resorted to, to expel them
without smoking. Some carry the cape to a distance
from the apiary, turn it upside down, rest
it on the ground, and cover it with a napkin,
leaving on one side a space of about a finger-length
uncovered, to allow an exit to the bees,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">- 42 -</span>
which, escaping by this opening, return to their
habitation; and, to hasten their departure, some
one knocks, from time to time, on the outside.</p>

<p>Others take a cape of the same size, place it
over the full one that is turned upside down,
bind them round with a napkin, to intercept all
passage to the bees, and force them to ascend into
the empty cape by tapping gently on the full
one. They soon go up into the empty cape, calling
on each other, and flapping their wings; and,
when they are all housed, replace them again on
the parent hive whence they were withdrawn;
and, if the season is favourable and the honey
abundant, they soon set to work again.</p>

<p>I prefer this last method, which is the speediest
and easiest.</p>

<span class="smaller">SIZE OF HIVES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Most</span> amateurs have all their hives of an equal
size. Some will have only very large ones;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">- 43 -</span>
others very small ones; and others there are who
prefer those of middling dimensions, into which
they lodge indifferently, early and late, weak
and strong, and even double swarms, that have
re-united on leaving the parent hive; this is not
very judicious. There should be a roomy lodging
for first and for strong swarms, and even
more so for double ones; and there ought to be
small hives to receive feeble and tardy swarms,
as well as for second and third ones at least, if
proprietors do not reinforce them, by uniting
them, according to my plan. Middling sized
hives are convenient for ordinary swarms, which
are neither the first nor the last ones.</p>

<p>When two or even three swarms come off at
the same time and mingle together, as sometimes
happens in large apiaries, I take care not to separate
them, but give them a hive big enough to
contain them all.</p>

<p>One strong population supports itself better,
and is incomparably more profitable, than feeble
colonies, that must be often in need of assistance.
But there is a measure in every thing, and there
should be no excess; should four or five swarms
mingle, it is proper to separate them and lodge
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">- 44 -</span>
them in two hives of suitable dimensions; when
I have not done so, I have always, except once,
had cause to regret it. Before swarming time,
it is as well to prepare hives of various sizes,
just as one would have casks ready in a cellar
before the vintage, to be ready for use. Here
experience is in harmony with reason.</p>

<span class="smaller">MANNER OF UNITING NEW SWARMS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Feeble</span> and tardy swarms can do no good excepting
in very fine seasons. In bad seasons they
greatly weaken the hives that produce them,
without being able to shift for themselves. In
ordinary years, they can only be preserved by
much care, and at the expence of a great deal of
honey; and most of them die, after all, without
bringing any profit to their master. I have
saved some that have turned out well, but only
at the end of two or even three years; and I advise
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">- 45 -</span>
no one to try the experiment unless they
have a great deal of honey to spare. It is better
to unite them, and proceed after the following
method:&mdash;</p>

<p>When two small swarms come off the same
day, I gather them separately, and leave them at
the foot of the tree or hush on which they have
alighted. Towards evening I spread a table-cloth
on the ground, on which, by a smart and
sudden movement, I shake all the bees out of
one of the hives, and immediately take the other
and place it gently over the bees that are heaped
together on the cloth, and they instantly ascend
into it, flapping their wings, and join those
which, not having been disturbed, are quiet in
their new abode. Early next morning I remove
this newly united hive to the place it is destined
to occupy. This doubled population works with
double success, and in the most perfect harmony;
and generally becomes a powerful colony,
from which a great profit is derived. Two feeble
swarms may be united after the same manner,
although one of them may have come off
some days later than the other, and the first may
have constructed combs; taking care, however,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">- 46 -</span>
not to make the first one enter the second, but
the second the first, as the bees will ascend more
readily to join those that have already begun to
make honey and to hatch brood; and next day
they will proceed together, with increased ardour,
with the work which the first had already
begun, and which will now advance more rapidly
from the increase of the labourers. It is
to be understood, that, after this union, the hive
should be placed early next morning in the same
place where the oldest of the swarms has already
passed some days.</p>

<p>I have recommended the uniting of swarms to
be effected in the evening, when the bees are
quietly housed for the night. If it were to be
during the day, when the labourers are in full
activity, they might fight and kill one another,
to the total destruction of one of the swarms,
which I have seen happen more than once. But
in the evening they are grouped together; those
that have been displaced alight upon, and take
hold of, the others, and thus merely extend the
cluster, now composed of two distinct masses,
the one covering the other: their peace is never
disturbed, and next day they work together in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">- 47 -</span>
perfect harmony. Their fighting is always after
the fashion of a duel, and not of a battle. In
their wars, they do not range themselves in close
battle lines, like men, breaking through and
overturning each other; they fight bee to bee,
excepting in cases of plunder or the killing of
the drones, and then the combatant who first engages
in the attack is speedily assisted by all
those within reach uniting their forces to overthrow
the enemy. But when the whole of a new
swarm, suddenly displaced, ascends precipitately
into a hive, peaceably occupied by another, the
bees of each colony cannot recognize each other,
and having no field to fight after their own fashion,
they pass the night together, and, doubtless,
acquiring the same smell, live happily together.
But such is not the case when we
wish to make a swarm enter an old hive, or to
unite it to one whose hive is already full of honey-combs.
Then another way of proceeding, and
precautions of another kind, are necessary, concerning
which I shall now give directions.</p>

<span class="smaller">METHODS OF UNITING TWO OR THREE SWARMS IN AUTUMN.</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the swarms have not been able to lay
up a sufficient provision during the fine weather,
I weigh them at the end of the season, and,
knowing the weight of each empty hive, I can
tell exactly the quantity of honey they have in
store.</p>

<p>If they are three, four, five or six pounds too
light, I preserve them, and feed them in the manner
I am about to detail. When the swarms
have only about one-third or one-half of the
quantity of honey which would suffice to feed
them, I might keep them alive by giving them
as much more as they require. I have frequently
done so; but I have already remarked, that
this plan costs too much honey, and gives too
much trouble; and therefore I generally join
them into one. For this purpose, I leave the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">- 49 -</span>
heaviest swarm untouched, and, in the morning
of a fine day in September, or beginning
of October, I commence by blowing a few
whiffs of tobacco-smoke with my pipe in at the
door of the hive of the lightest swarm, to disperse
the sentinels; then, turning up the hive,
and placing it on its top on the ground, I give
it a little more smoke, to prevent the bees from
becoming irritated, and to force them to retire
within the combs. I proceed to cut out all the
combs in succession, beginning with the smallest,
sweeping the bees with a feather off each
piece back into the hive; and then I place the
combs, one after another, into a large dish beside
me, keeping it, at the same time, carefully covered
over with a napkin or small table-cloth, to
prevent the bees returning to their combs, or the
smell of the honey attracting others that may be
flying about. The last comb is the most difficult
to come at, being completely covered over with
bees. I detach it, however, in the same way as
the others, but with greater precaution, sweeping
the bees off very gently with the feather until
there is not one left on it. This operation I
perform without gloves or any other protection,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">- 50 -</span>
armed only with my pipe; and, for ten times
that I treat them after this fashion, I seldom receive
one sting, even when I act unassisted.</p>

<p>The combs being all removed, the swarm remains
as completely destitute of food as it was
on the day of its emigration, and I replace it on
its board in the same spot it occupied when full,
and leave it till the evening, by which time the
bees will be clustered together like a new swarm.
During the whole of the day, which I shall suppose
to be fine, they occupy themselves with
great earnestness cleaning their house, and making
such a noise in removing the little fragments
of wax that have fallen on the board, that
any one who did not know it had been emptied,
would take it for the best and strongest of the
hives. Before night, when they are all quiet, I
throw a few whiffs of smoke in at the door of
the hive which I mean my deprived swarm to
enter, and which should be its next neighbour,
on the right hand or the left; then, turning it up
and resting it on the ground, I sprinkle it all
over with honey, especially between the combs
where I perceive the greatest number of bees:
five or six table-spoonfuls generally suffice; at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">- 51 -</span>
other times three or four times as many are
required. If too little were given, the new
comers might not be well received; there might
be some fighting; and, by giving too much, we
run the risk of drowning them. One should
cease the sprinkling when the bees begin to climb
up above the combs, and shelter themselves on
the sides of the hive: this done, I replace the
hive on its board, which should jut out about
seven or eight inches, raising the hive up in front
with two little bits of stick, so as to leave a division
of an inch in front between it and the
board, to give free access to the bees. I also
spread a table-cloth on the ground before it,
raising and fixing one end of it on the board, by
means of the two bits of sticks that are placed as
a temporary support to the hive. I then take the
hive that was deprived of its combs in the morning,
and, with one shake, throw the bees out of
it upon the table-cloth, which they instantly begin
to ascend; while, by the help of a long wooden
spoon, I guide them to the door of the one
that is placed for their reception. A few spoonfuls
of the bees raised and laid down at the door
of the hive, will set the example,&mdash;they enter at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">- 52 -</span>
once, and the others follow quickly, flapping
their wings and sipping with delight the drops
of honey that come in their way, or officiously
licking and cleaning those first inhabitants that
have received the sprinkling, and with whom
they mingle and live henceforth on good terms.
One division of the new comers always clusters
on the front of the hive, which they enter during
the night without disturbance, much pleased
to rejoin their companions. Next morning early
it is necessary to take away the table-cloth
and the bits of stick that were placed to raise up
the hive and facilitate the entrance of the bees,
and for some days the door should be left as
wide as possible. The hive should also be moved
a little to the right or left, that it may stand precisely
in the centre of the place they both occupied
before the union.</p>

<p>I have frequently united three swarms in the
same manner, and with the same success, taking
care only to empty in the morning those on each
side, and to make the bees enter the middle one
in the evening, after it has been sprinkled with
honey. In this case I do not remove the one
that unites the three swarms. The reason of this
we shall soon see.</p>

<span class="smaller">MANNER OF UNITING OLD HIVES IN AUTUMN.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>When old hives are weakened by giving out
too many swarms, and have not amassed a sufficient
provision for the winter, many proprietors
place them one above another, simply making
an opening in the board, to serve as a communication
between them, and closing the entrance
to the upper one, with a little clay, for the purpose
of making the bees go out and in through
the lower one by the only opening that is left
them. Several authors advise it; I have done it
also, but shall do so no more, having found it
attended by two serious inconveniences.</p>

<p>The first is, that the two colonies do not always
agree; indeed they fight sometimes to extremity,
and thus the one is destroyed and the
other is weakened. The reason is, that the bees
of the upper hive, descending one by one, or only
few at a time, are examined at leisure by those
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">- 54 -</span>
in the lower one, and, not having the same signal,
are mistaken for robbers, and killed without
mercy. This occurred to me the first time
I attempted to unite them in this way; but it
never happens in the tumultuous union of two
swarms, when the one has been sprinkled and
almost glued with honey, in consequence of
which it is not in a fit state to commence an attack
on those that are hastily displaced.</p>

<p>A second inconvenience is, that, even supposing
there should be no warfare, the habitation is
much too large for those that are henceforth intended
to be but one family. Whether they
unite in the upper or the under hive, one of them
must be left empty, into which thieves can find
easier access; and although they should not be
plundered, they would suffer from the cold of
a severe winter. The population, indeed, is
doubled, but so is the size of the lodging, and in
that case there will be no swarms. Very large
hives seldom swarm, it requires so much more
time to fill them. My method has not these disadvantages,
for two families living together in
the same hive are warmer, and better able to resist
any hostile attack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">- 55 -</span></p>

<p>It is to avoid these two inconveniences that,
in autumn, I empty an old hive which has not
sufficient provision, and, in the evening of the
same day, I introduce the bees into one of its
neighbours on the right hand or on the left, proceeding
in the same manner as with the swarms;
with this single difference, that the sprinkling of
honey should be more liberal to the old hive than
to the swarm.</p>

<p>If the hive of which I have doubled the population
is well enough furnished with provision
for the winter, I give it nothing. And if there
is not enough, I give it before winter as much
as it requires, in the manner hereafter to be detailed.</p>

<span class="smaller">NEIGHBOURING HIVES SHOULD BE UNITED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>I HAVE already said, in <a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chapter III.</a> that bees
which have not swarmed voluntarily return to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">- 56 -</span>
the place they have been accustomed to, even
after having been shut up for months: the same
thing would happen if you united swarms distant
from each other. Next day, or the day after,
you would have the mortification to see the
bees return by hundreds to their old residence,
flutter about for a length of time, and lose their
lives, either by falling down from fatigue, or
throwing themselves into the neighbouring hives,
where they are put to death. Not having left
their new dwelling with the same precaution
that a swarm uses to reconnoitre the one it has
chosen, or that has been given to it, and, supposing
themselves at home, in spite of the disorder
of the night before, they rush out on a rapid
flight, and, returning from their excursion, go
back to the place of their ancient domicil; and
thus the purpose of fortifying your hives, and of
preserving them, by uniting them, is defeated.
I have frequently tried to unite distant hives,
and always met with this result.</p>

<p>There is only one remedy for this that I know
of, but it is an imperfect one, and gives a great
deal of trouble. It is, to put in some combs of
wax into the hive that has been emptied, and replace
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">- 57 -</span>
it in its old situation. The bees return to it
in great numbers the following day, and some days
after; at length, after a great deal of bustle, they
settle towards evening on the combs, and, before
night, when they are quite tranquil, I take the
combs one after another, and, with a feather,
sweep off the bees, so as to make them fall upon
the board of the one that contains their companions,
and which they now enter with evident
marks of joy. This operation may require to be
repeated for seven or eight days, with this difference,
that every succeeding day fewer will return.
Thus the evil may be repaired, though
incompletely and with infinite trouble.</p>

<p>It is to avoid the perplexity which displacing
them occasions to these precious insects, and also
the loss that results to myself, that I move the
united hive a little to one side, so that it may
occupy the space that was before between them.
As displacing them only a few inches does not
confuse them, for the same reason, when I join
three hives, as I often do, I never displace the
middle one, but remove those I have emptied
on the right hand and on the left, which is sufficient
to prevent mistakes, and the bees, finding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">- 58 -</span>
no hive on either side, enter the middle one without
hesitation. It is a very essential point, however,
to join only neighbouring hives, as being
less troublesome and more successful.</p>

<p>It would be a good plan to mingle in the
apiary strong and weak hives alternately, and to
place small and late swarms near each other, in
order to unite two and two, or three and three,
in autumn, if they have not enough of provision
laid up for their winter subsistence.</p>

<p>When a deprived swarm happens not to be
near another in the same state, there is nothing
to hinder it being united to any old well provisioned
hive that may be near it, as it will thrive
all the better for such an addition to its population.
I have done so oftener than once, and always
with success.</p>

<span class="smaller">HOW TO FEED UNITED SWARMS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is always honey in hives that are emptied
to be united. If there are six pounds more
or less, I lay aside the combs that are full, after
having separated those that are but half
filled, and of which the cells are not hermetically
sealed by the little thin chip of transparent
white wax which invariably covers those cells
that are full of honey. Twelve or fourteen days
after the union, when the cold forces the bees to
congregate themselves in their hives, I give the
hive that contains the double population a few
puffs of tobacco-smoke; then, turning it upside
down, I cut away the empty combs, that are always
below and on the sides of the hive. While
performing this operation, it is necessary to give
them an occasional whiff of smoke to keep them
quiet. I only take out the one-half of those that
are half filled with honey, and cease as soon as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">- 60 -</span>
I find the comb quite full. When there is room
enough to contain the fragments of honey-comb
that I mean to put in, I place them as nicely as
I can, without breaking or bruising them, filling
the empty space, without leaving any division
but the little intervals between the combs, to allow
a free passage to the bees. This done, I lay a
board over it, and, with the aid of another person,
we return it gently to its former position,
and, shaking it as little as possible, replace it in
its proper situation.</p>

<p>This operation may be done in the morning
or in the evening, but never in the heat of the
day. I prefer the evening, in order not to attract
thieves.</p>

<p>The diligent bees soon discover the change
that has taken place; and finding bits of honey-comb
heaped up in all directions, they set about
giving them solidity, soldering them together
before the following night, in such a manner,
that all these fragments soon form one mass, intersected
only by little alleys of communication.
Thus it remains during the whole of the winter;
and, in the month of March or April, according
to the temperature of the weather, I take out
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">- 61 -</span>
this irregular mass, which I find entirely emptied;
the bees having lived upon it, and spared
the provisions which they had stored in the middle
of the hive.</p>

<p>I have supposed that the hive whose population
I have doubled has also received the addition
of six pounds of honey-comb, given in the
way I have just described. These constitute, as it
were, the dowry of the new comers, who are
themselves at the whole expence, as it was they
who constructed and filled the combs of which
I took possession. The doubled hive having
then sufficient food to subsist on till spring, I
trouble it no more, certain, from past experience,
that I shall then find it in good condition. Every
one of these swarms would have perished from
want, had they lived separately; and, by joining,
I give them the means of subsistence, without
costing myself any thing. If the supposed six
pounds do not suffice to support them, I lend
them more; I say <i>lend</i>, for the bees always return
with interest whatever advances are made
to them.</p>

<p>I proceed exactly after the same manner when
I unite two old hives that have not been able to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">- 62 -</span>
lay up a sufficient provision, remembering always,
as already mentioned, that old dark-coloured
combs, being much heavier than white
ones, contain also less honey, and that, consequently,
it requires a greater number of pounds
to make up a pot of this nectar. The difference
is so great, that six pounds of white comb will
produce more than a pot of honey, whereas the
same quantity can scarcely be extracted from
eight, or even ten, pounds of black comb.</p>

<span class="smaller">QUANTITY OF FOOD REQUISITE FOR UNITED HIVES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> said, in <a href="#CHAPTER_IX">Chapter IX.</a> that each hive must
have three pots, or fifteen pounds of honey, to
sustain it during the winter, and until the bees
can find food for themselves again in the spring.
For this reason, I have advised the empty hives
to be weighed, before the swarm is admitted into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">- 63 -</span>
it, and again in the autumn, when the honey
season is over, in order that we may be assured
that there is food enough to maintain them during
the winter.</p>

<p>In doubling the population, I naturally expected
that we must also double the quantity of
food, for I had always seen that two or three families,
living together, used more meat than each
would have done singly, however rigid their economy.
The more mouths the more meat, thought
I; and, in consequence, I augmented greatly the
amount of provision the first time I doubled a
hive; but, to my great astonishment, when I
weighed it again in the spring, I found that the
united swarm had not consumed more than each
would have done singly. I could not believe my
eyes, but thought there must be some mistake,
nor could I be convinced, until I had repeated
the experiment a hundred times over, and had
always the same result.</p>

<p>I have made a point, in every instance, to mention
the reasons of my advice and proceedings;
here, however, I humbly confess my inability to
do so, nor can I conceive how an army of thirty
thousand troops could be served with the same
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">- 64 -</span>
rations allowed for an army of only ten thousand,
supposing the soldiers of both to have an
equal appetite, and to have each wherewith to satisfy
it. But the fact exists in regard to the bees;
any one may have it in his power to convince
himself of it; the cause is to me unknown, and
must be left to wiser heads than mine to explain.
Does the increase of heat supply, to a certain extent,
the place of nourishment? Does the greater
and more uniform heat, in a well-stocked hive,
make the food more nourishing?</p>

<p>These are questions which I propose to naturalists,
but which I cannot answer.</p>

<p>After this discovery, as important as it seems
to be inexplicable, I varied my experiments, not
only to convince myself of the fact, but, if possible,
to arrive at more extended results. I joined
three hives in the autumn, by introducing into
the middle one, the bees of two neighbouring
hives; and I found, on weighing it in the spring,
that its inhabitants had scarcely used one pound
more than those of hives that had not been united.
I went farther: Having a large well-stocked
and amply provided hive, I added to it, in the
autumn, without displacing it, the swarms of four
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">- 65 -</span>
neighbouring hives, two on the right hand and
two on the left, that were so scarce of provisions
that the quantity of honey that would have been
necessary to have kept them alive, would have
far exceeded their value, and that all the four
would, to a certainty? have perished. This enormous
population produced a heat so great, that,
during the whole of a very severe winter, the
bees kept up a buzzing noise equal to that of a
strong and active hive in the evening of a fine
day in spring. The steam expelled by the vibration
of their wings, collected in drops at the
door, and formed icicles round the entrance of
the hive during severe frost. The hive was
left out all the winter, and would infallibly have
perished had I shut it up; and what was my astonishment,
on weighing it in the spring, to
find that, notwithstanding that it contained five
pounds, the total diminution did not exceed three
pounds more than took place in my ordinary
hives. It gave out excellent swarms, long before
any of the others, and recompensed me well
for my pains. I have not repeated the experiment
to the same extent, but have limited myself
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">- 66 -</span>
to the union of two, or at most three deprived
hives, and have been very well paid.</p>

<p>What, in these circumstances, becomes of the
supernumerary queens, since their hatred to one
another is so great that there can be but one in
each colony? I give myself no trouble to answer
the question, more curious than useful; the
aim of my experiments being only to give practical
rules.</p>

<p>I have often been astonished that so important
a discovery should not have been made sooner by
some of the superior minds that have taken an
interest in this branch of rural economy; and
that, in the course of their researches, not one of
them should have thought of uniting two or three
weak swarms, before winter, to compare them
with single swarms, in order to ascertain how
much honey was necessary, according to both
plans, till the end of the winter season. Doubtless
they had believed, as I formerly did, that
the more numerous the family the more provisions
would they require, and that little would
thus be gained by uniting them. I should have
regretted quitting the world before publishing
this discovery; and it had nearly perished with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">- 67 -</span>
me; for, continued and indispensable occupations,
as well as a dangerous illness, prevented
me setting about giving it to the public, till now
that I am far advanced in life.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.<br />

<span class="smaller">BENEFITS RESULTING FROM THE UNION OF WEAK HIVES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> advantages of uniting weak hives are
very considerable. I need only mention three.
1. The bees are saved; 2. They are saved without
trouble or expence; 3. All the hives are
strong.</p>

<p>The first of these advantages is the preservation
of the bees. In every country, swarms are
destroyed that have not been able to gather a
sufficient store of provision. Those found to be
too light are unmercifully condemned to be suffocated;
and what little honey they have collected,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">- 68 -</span>
is considered as pure gain, because the bees
would have perished from want, after having
consumed the scanty fruits of their own industry;
and, by putting them to death a little sooner,
something at least may be made of them.
Thus people reason, and thus the murderous
practice is so generally adopted. The same plan
is followed in regard to old hives that are exhausted
by giving out too many swarms; and in
short, to all those that have not abundance of
provision laid up; and the very heavy ones, on
the other hand, have their bees slain to get possession
of the honey. What a frightful proscription
is this! What blanks occur in the apiaries,
especially in bad years, such as 1812 and 1813!
And how injurious to our own interest is this indiscriminate
destruction of weak and healthy, of
rich and poor! There is no mercy shewn but
to them that have just enough to keep them alive;
and not even one of them would be spared, were
they not indispensably necessary to repeople the
apiaries by new swarms. According to my method,
all these evils are prevented. All the hives
may be robbed of their treasures; but the lives of
the bees are spared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">- 69 -</span></p>

<p>A second and very considerable advantage is
the saving of honey. I have already said, that
there must be at least three pots or fifteen pounds
of honey to maintain one hive, whether it be
strong or weak. If three swarms, then, have
only that quantity among them, each has but a
third of the provision that it requires; and, to
keep them alive, you must sacrifice six pots of
honey, that is, two-thirds of the whole provision,
or two pots for each. It is to avoid this great
expence, which would equal if not exceed the
value of the swarms, that most people have recourse
to the prompt measure of suffocation.
But, by uniting the swarms, all the working
bees may be saved, without any expence, and
without any waste of honey but the small quantity
employed to sprinkle the combs of the hive,
into which you make them enter. The honey-combs
found in those which you empty, are sufficient
to feed the three united swarms, by giving
it to them after the manner I have directed
at page 33. The wax is all your own. It costs
only a little care and a little trouble, which will
be amply repaid by the benefit insured. And
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">- 70 -</span>
will it be accounted a slight pleasure to witness
the prosperity of the bees we have saved?</p>

<p>A third advantage, which appears to me one of
great value, is, that all the hives which we possess
are strong hives (meaning by the term strong,
such hives as are well stocked with bees). Weak
hives decline and yield nothing; have frequent
need of assistance; are exposed to pillage; give
out no swarms; and produce scarcely heat sufficient
to hatch a little brood in a corner of their
dwelling, which never comes to good. How often
have I seen the brood come to an untimely
end. In vain the bees will crowd together, to
procure the necessary degree of heat, when there
is much empty space in the hive. A number of
weak hives may do well enough to make a shew
in the apiary, but will be no profit to the proprietor.
It costs a good deal to feed them, if one
would keep them alive; and there is very little
to be gained by putting them to death. Not so
with the united hives; they were all vigorous; in
condition to defy the rigour of the seasons; to
repel their enemies; and to gather a great quantity
of honey. The population augments rapidly,
and they give out early swarms; or if some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">- 71 -</span>
of them do not produce swarms, they furnish
so much the more wax and honey, and will collect
more in one day than weak hives will do in
a whole week; in short, there is no comparison
between them.</p>

<span class="smaller">TIME AND MANNER OF RENEWING OLD HIVES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a common prejudice, that hives cannot
be profitably preserved beyond three, four, or
six years at most, and that, beyond that term,
they become weak, give out no more swarms,
and finish by being pillaged, or becoming the
prey of moths, which, if suffered to establish
themselves, soon make horrible devastation among
them. A great many experiments, however,
have fully convinced me that such is not
the case, and that the duration of the hives may
be greatly prolonged by renewing them.</p>

<p>I have several from twelve to twenty years
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">- 72 -</span>
old, that are as prosperous, and swarm as well,
as the young ones. I have even one of June
1789, consequently now in its twenty-fifth year,
and it gave off an excellent swarm on the 4th of
June 1811, the same in 1813, then aged twenty-four
years, and again another this year 1814.
Besides these numerous swarms, I have taken
from it 142 pounds of honey-comb, either by
pruning, or by means of capes. I have never
united it with other bees, because its neighbours
had always enough to subsist on, and I have renewed
it only once.</p>

<p>The decay of old hives proceeds from three
causes. The first is the candying of the old honey,
of which the bees have sometimes an ample
store, but which, from inability to eat it, becomes
in that state very troublesome, in place of being
of use to them. When forced by hunger to have
recourse to it, they draw it out of the cells, and
throw it down on the board that serves as a floor
to their habitation, in order to profit by any of
the sweet drops that happen to be in a liquid
state. In nibbling and scraping to empty the
cells, it happens that many of them become so
daubed, that, being unable to get away from it,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">- 73 -</span>
they fall down, and soon perish, if the weather
is cold. Thus the old honey is lost as much to
the proprietors as to the labourers that have gathered
it. Supposing, again, that they do not
touch it, the place it occupies is lost either for
the purpose of depositing new honey or brood,
and hence the weak state the hives fall into, if
not renewed.</p>

<p>A second cause of their decay is owing to the
great quantity of the pollen or dust of flowers
that the bees gather and carry home on their
legs, especially in the spring and autumn, when
large portions of the combs will be found filled
with it on both sides. It is an essential ingredient
in the pap with which they nourish the
young brood, but good for nothing else. Different
authors have named it <i>bee-bread</i>; but the
bees never eat it: indeed it is a well attested fact,
that they will die of hunger on the combs that
are filled with it. As it is very heavy, it sometimes
cheats those people who estimate the provision
of a hive by its weight. This is one of
the reasons why I have recommended, in Chap. IX.
to allow eight or ten pounds more to old
hives than to new swarms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">- 74 -</span></p>

<p>The bee-bread being generally, when present,
deposited in the centre of the combs, where the
brood thrives best, of course the place which it
takes up is so much lost. It is liable to mould
in winter, and the working bees have a great
deal of trouble in tearing it from the cells, and
putting it out of their way. It spoils the honey,
takes away its whiteness, and gives it an unpleasant
taste; it destroys the wax even more, and
forms that brown scum under the cakes, when
great care is not taken to separate it. Nevertheless,
bees lay up useless hoards of it, which they
go on augmenting every year: and this is the
only point on which they can be accused of a
want of that prudence and foresight so admirable
in every other respect. By renovating the hives,
one frees them of this superfluous substance, and
the space it occupied is directly replaced by beautiful
white combs, and the whole hive becomes
as good as new.</p>

<p>A third cause of the weakness of an old hive
is the blackness of the combs in the centre and
front of the hive. These old combs are mostly
pierced with holes large enough to hold two or
three fingers, or even a whole hand. They are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">- 75 -</span>
not openings which the bees have cut out for
themselves, to pass from one comb to another;
but are the result of some violent measure to
which they have had recourse, for the purpose
of defending themselves from the moths, one of
which, establishing itself in a comb, will soon
destroy the whole hive, if they do not speedily
rid themselves of it. The young moth is not so
easily got the better of, being cased in a sort of
strong silk, by means of which it forms galleries,
and slides from side to side of the hive; and the
bees are unable either to get within reach of the
enemy, or to rend this silken covering that defends
it; but, perceiving their danger, they join
together in forming a plan of attack for their deliverance,
by gnawing the comb in which the
moth is established, as far as the galleries extend;
throw down the piece, and finish by reducing
it to crumbs, and never rest until they
kill the foe. They require to be in great force
for this operation. Weak hives need not attempt
it; indeed they generally finish by becoming the
prey of the moths.</p>

<p>It is singular that bees, which know so well
how to build combs, should not be able to repair
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">- 76 -</span>
them. I have found as many as six of these
holes in one comb. Are they left standing thus,
like so many monuments of victories gained over
a formidable enemy,&mdash;the most formidable and
the most difficult to conquer? All useless combs
should be taken away, as they tend to weaken
the hive, and they will soon be replaced by entire
and healthy ones.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE SIGNS BY WHICH TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER A
HIVE REQUIRES TO BE RENEWED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> long as a hive produces honey and swarms,
it is needless to touch it; but, when it ceases to be
productive,&mdash;when, during several months, the
bees form clusters, without swarming, I then
think it necessary to renew, or, properly speaking,
to prune it; the directions for which will be
best understood by my simply relating how I
managed my two first experiments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">- 77 -</span></p>

<p>The first time I performed this operation was
on a pretty large-sized straw-hive, which, for ten
years, was very productive. One year alone, it
yielded me seventy-two pounds of very fine honey-comb
in the capes, mentioned in <a href="#CHAPTER_X">Chapter X.</a>
The eleventh and twelfth years it made
me no return, though it was heavy and very
populous. About the beginning of the thirteenth
year, I gave it a little tobacco-smoke, with my
pipe, and proceeded to prune the combs away
with my knife, until I came to brood. There
remained only four in front, in which the bees
always begin to lay their eggs in the spring.
They were very black, and contained little honey,
but I saved them, that the population might not
be destroyed. The honey that I took out was
hard and candied, but I melted it with a little
wine; and, filling some bits of empty combs
with it, gave them a part of it two or three times
a-week, being careful to place them in the hive
in the evening, and take them out again in the
morning, for fear of attracting thieves.</p>

<p>I thus fed the bees with their own store; the
combs were always empty in the morning. By
the month of April, they began to build in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">- 78 -</span>
space I had left. By the middle of May, they had
completely filled it with beautiful white combs,
like those of a new swarm; and the same year,
on the 9th of June, it gave me, contrary to my
expectation, an excellent swarm. Next year, by
the end of March, I took away the four black
combs that I had left, and in which was no brood.
The brood was by this time deposited in the
middle combs; thus my hive was completely renewed.</p>

<p>Encouraged by this success, I performed the
same operation next spring, on a common sized
hive, which, during eleven years, had annually
yielded me honey or swarms: one year I took
from it forty pounds of beautiful honey-comb;
but, for two years, it had been languid and unproductive.
On the 4th of March, I pruned away
all the combs, excepting two in front, containing
brood; and I nourished the bees, by giving them
a little of the liquid honey every evening, upon a
bit of comb, until they could get out to gather
food for themselves.</p>

<p>In the month of May, all the combs that I had
cut out were replaced with the most beautiful
new ones. This hive, which was weaker than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">- 79 -</span>
the other, gave out no swarm the same year, but
it filled a cape with some pounds of honey-comb,
which I took possession of.</p>

<p>The following year, on the 4th of March, I cut
away the two black combs that were left in front,
and thus this hive was also entirely renewed;
after which it produced me four swarms, and
nearly forty pounds of honey-combs in the capes:
this I consider a clear profit, there not being the
smallest doubt that the hive would have perished,
had it not been renewed.</p>

<p>These two examples may suffice to shew the
advantage to be derived from the renewing of old
hives. What would mine have yielded had I resorted
to the common method of suffocating the
bees? A little indifferent honey; for that of
candied combs is very inferior to that of new
ones. As to the wax, I should have had no
more, since I took away all that the hives contained,
and the exchange gave me good strong
colonies, which are more valuable than the best
swarms.</p>

<p>The advantage of my plan will be better understood,
if we shall suppose two neighbouring
apiaries, equally good, and in all respects equally
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">- 80 -</span>
well taken care of. Suppose one of them shall
be managed in the ordinary way, and that, every
year, the owners shall suffocate the heaviest
swarms for the sake of the honey, and that they
also destroy the old hives that have too little provision
for the winter. Let the other apiary be
managed according to the principles I have detailed,
that not one bee shall be put to death,
and that, in the autumn, the swarms that are
too light, as well as the old hives that are scarce
of food, shall be united, and that the latter shall
be renewed when they cease to prosper.</p>

<p>At the end of fifteen years, compare these two
apiaries, and see which has the strongest hives,
the greatest number, and in the best condition.
It would be surprising indeed, if they preserved
their original equality.</p>

<p>Will these operations be objected to, on account
of the difficulties attending the performance
of them? Will it be said that every one has not
the courage to run the risk of being stung, or
the dexterity to set about handling the bees?</p>

<p>In all countries there are people to be found
who are accustomed to gather swarms, and to
put joinings on hives. Let them be employed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">- 81 -</span>
and directed in every part of the work that the
proprietors do not like to perform themselves.
This practice is common in Lusatia, a country
celebrated in the history of bees, by the very
useful discoveries of M. <span class="smcap">Shirach</span>, and where they
make annually, according to his principles, a
great quantity of artificial swarms. The country
people, of whom the greater number understand
nothing of these complex operations, which take
more time, and are much more difficult than the
union of swarms, or the renewing of hives, employ
people who are bred to the business, and
who, in the proper season, go from village to
village, making swarms, and are paid for their
trouble.</p>

<p>From the result of my experiments, it is evident
that the duration of hives is indefinite; and
here a multitude of questions present themselves.
How long does a queen live? Would she live
twenty years and more? Is the term of her existence
prolonged beyond that of the working
bees? I cannot answer; but I have reason to
think that bees live only one year, and that those
which have lived over the winter, and have assisted
at the work during the spring and summer,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">- 82 -</span>
and which do not perish by accident, die of
age in the month of August. By that time, they
seem to become paralytic; and, unable to fly, they
fall down in the neighbourhood of the hives, and
creep about until they expire from fatigue and
exhaustion.</p>

<p>One then sees many of them, with their wings
fringed, which is a sign of decrepitude, similar
to the wrinkles of an old person; while the young-bees
may be discerned by their grey ashy colour,
which becomes darker, approaching to black,
as they get older. I do not believe that the
queen (on whose existence depends that of the
colony), lives ten, fifteen, or twenty times longer
than the working bees. But they have the means
of filling her place when she comes to die. M.
<span class="smcap">Shirach</span> has completely demonstrated, by very
varied and multiplied experiments, that they require
only for that purpose a common bee-worm
that has been hatched within two or three days,
and that this worm becomes a queen, and a fruitful
queen, in less than a fortnight, by means of
a thicker, more roomy, and differently formed
cell, which they construct expressly for her, and
by a different sort of pap with which she is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">- 83 -</span>
nourished. I have repeated the experiment oftener
than once.</p>

<p>Forty days after I had put a bit of brood-comb
into a wired box, after the manner of M. <span class="smcap">Shirach</span>,
I saw young bees come out; and the young queen
I had made be hatched, was the mother of my
artificial swarm. It is therefore probable that a
hive, from twenty to twenty-five years old, has
not always the same queen, but that the queen
has, from time to time, been replaced. Moreover,
every time that a swarm comes off, it is
the old queen that emigrates with it.</p>

<p>The sudden decline of a hive that has lost its
queen, and which never long survives the loss,
when it has not young brood to create another,
proves that bees live but one year, as the depopulation
would be less rapid if the lives of the
individuals extended beyond that term.</p>

<span class="smaller">ARTIFICIAL SWARMS AND DIFFERENT METHODS OF FORMING THEM.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>One often sees well-stocked hives that do not
swarm, and which, during the whole of the summer,
form large clusters, until the cold of the
autumnal evenings forces the idlers to re-enter
their hives; and it were vain to disturb them, to
smoke them, or torment them, in the hope of
forcing them to swarm. Some people have
thought they might attain their object by dividing
them in two; but they did not succeed.
There are, however, two ways of obtaining artificial
swarms; and the one which the celebrated
Shirach practised successfully in Alsatia, and
which was followed with the same results in the
north of Germany, requires a long course of difficult
and complex operations. I shall, however,
proceed to give my readers some idea of it.</p>

<p>In spring, a little box is prepared, about six
inches square, with an opening in the top, about
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">- 85 -</span>
three inches square, and another the same size in
front. Each of these openings is covered with a
wire-grating, close enough to prevent any bee getting
through. This box rests on a stand provided
with twelve wooden pins, four or five inches
long, placed perpendicularly, in two rows, at the
distance of three inches from each other. These
pins should be so far separate as that five pieces
of honey-comb, each about as big as a person's
hand, may be placed between them.</p>

<p>Between the farthest of the pins, on the right
and left hand, are put three bits of empty combs,
the same height as the pins: a piece of very fine
honey-comb, not candied, occupies the fourth
place; and the fifth, which is the centre, remains
empty. It is to be understood that the pins
supporting the combs on both sides, keep them
in a perpendicular situation, and prevent them
touching each other, and that the spaces left between
the combs is much about the same as
those in the hive to allow free passage to the
bees. Neither the honey-comb nor the empty
combs ought to touch the board, in case of the
moths taking possession of them; they are rather
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">- 86 -</span>
made to rest on two little bits of wood, raised a
little above the board, and crossed by the pins.</p>

<p>Above the combs and the pins, a large piece
of comb is placed horizontally, and covering the
whole, to keep in the heat while the hatching
goes on.</p>

<p>After all these preliminaries, a fine day is
chosen, about the end of April or beginning of
May, according to the climate, and according as
the season is more or less advanced; and, in the
heat of the day, a little before noon, a strong
hive, while in full activity, is lifted up, its top
rested on the ground, and the bees driven off the
combs with a little tobacco smoke, in order that
the proper pieces may be seen and chosen.</p>

<p>A piece of comb, about the size of a hand, is
then cut out, containing all the three kinds of
brood, that is, eggs, nymphs, but principally the
little maggots, just two or three days out of the
shell. The hive is then replaced on its stand,
and the little bit of comb that was taken out of
it is put into the box, to occupy the empty space
that was left in the centre, between the pins,
and about a thousand or fifteen hundred bees,
taken from a cluster in some other manner, are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">- 87 -</span>
then introduced, and the box closed, to prevent
them getting out.</p>

<p>Their extreme agitation, approaching to despair,
produces a heat so great that they would
be suffocated, but for the wire-gratings above and
in front. Towards night, when they become
tranquil, nothing more is heard but a soft murmuring,
and they begin to construct one of the
great cells, that has its opening underneath, and
in which they nurse and rear queens. Before
the cell is completed, they carry into it a little
maggot, out of the egg within two days; which
being then suitably nourished, becomes a perfect
queen in less than a fortnight.</p>

<p>For three days the box should be kept shut,
and the light carefully excluded, for it would
only serve to increase the agitation of the prisoners;
and the upper wire-grating, being of no
farther use, may be plastered over with a little
clay. The fourth day the box may be carried
to the apiary, and the bees set at liberty, by
opening a part of the wire-grating in front.</p>

<p>Having now got a new establishment, with the
certainty of soon having a queen, they think no
more of returning to the hives whence they were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">- 88 -</span>
taken, but come and go, cleaning their little
dwelling, and working like a weak swarm.</p>

<p>While they are thus occupied, a little cage
should be prepared, in which to shut up the
queen when her metamorphoses shall be completed.</p>

<p>This cage is of a semicircular form, and in
size resembling the half of a large orange; it is
made of wood, scooped out, and has a wire-grating
on the front of it, so fine that no bee can
get out or in: a hole is made in the lower part
of it, large enough to permit a bee to pass through,
and a wooden pin, from six to eight inches long,
of the size of the hole, is prepared to shut it up
with.</p>

<p>These preparations being completed, the box
is opened fourteen or fifteen days after the bees
have been put in, but it must be one of these
fine spring days when the bees are busy at work:
should the weather be cold or wet, the opening
of the box must be delayed. The combs are then
all taken out, and the queen will be easily discovered.
She is much longer in the body, and
altogether larger, than the other bees, as may
be observed from the following figures, where
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">- 89 -</span>
<a href="#fig_1-2-3">Fig. 1.</a> represents the Queen; <a href="#fig_1-2-3">Fig. 2.</a> the Drone;

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><a href="#fig_1-2-3">Fig. 1.</a> The <i>Queen Bee</i>: the head is of a triangular shape;
her wings very short, not extending beyond the one-half
of her body, which is longer, and more pointed,
than that of the working bees. Her legs and corselet
are copper coloured; thorax grey, and abdomen brown.
There is only one queen to a hive; while there are from
10,000 to 15,000 workers, and perhaps 1000 or 1200
drones.</p>

<p><a href="#fig_1-2-3">Fig. 2.</a> The <i>Drone</i>, or Male Bee; the head is round, its
large body is almost entirely covered by its wings. It
has no sting. The drones appear only at the season of
swarming, and are all put to death by the workers in
the autumn.</p>

<p><a href="#fig_1-2-3">Fig. 3.</a> The <i>Working Bee</i>. Head somewhat triangular; the
smallest and most numerous of the hive, which every
one knows as the <i>honey-bee</i>, and which fabricates the
combs, makes the honey, and feeds the young.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">- 90 -</span></p>

<p class="p0">The queen must be seized by the wings and introduced,
head foremost, through the hole into
the cage, along with a dozen bees to bear her
company, and then the hole through which they
have passed is stopped up with the wooden pin.
This being completed, an empty hive must be
prepared, similar, in every respect, to the one
out of which artificially the swarm is to be taken.
A hole, parallel to that in the cage, is
pierced in the bench on which it is to stand, and
the end of the wooden pin fixed into it, so that
the cage may be suspended, perpendicularly,
about two-thirds the height of the hive. Between
eleven and twelve of the same day, while
the bees are mostly on the wing, a strong person
takes one of the old hives, that is not likely to
swarm, lifts it steadily, and rests it for a few seconds
on a table, at hand for the purpose, while
its place is instantly filled by the one containing
the young queen and her cage. Any bees that
may be grouped about the board are lifted up
with a wooden spoon, and laid down at the
door of the new hive; these ascend immediately;
and all the working bees, returning in crowds
from the fields, enter without hesitation; when,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">- 91 -</span>
finding neither combs, nor honey, nor any provision
whatever, they go out and return several
times, and fly round and round it; while the inhabitants
of the old hive, having no suspicion of
their place being changed, leave it without precaution,
return to the situation of their ancient
dwelling, and increase the swarm that is forming.</p>

<p>Wearied at length of their researches, and
finding in this new establishment a great number
of their companions, with an imprisoned
queen, they unite themselves together at the top
of the hive, begin, even the same evening, to
build combs; and thus is obtained an excellent
artificial swarm. Next day, and some days after,
many bees continue to join them from the
old hive, which delays not to repeople itself from
the brood-comb with which it is filled, as it is
not more weakened than if it had swarmed naturally.
The second day after this operation
the new hive must be lifted up, the cage taken
out, and the queen set at liberty, which is easily
done, by drawing out two or three of the wires
that form the grating. It would not be possible
to make her descend by the hole through which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">- 92 -</span>
she entered, and, by delaying too long to take
her out, she would be completely surrounded by
combs, that must be broken before she could be
released. The precaution of keeping the queen
in prison for two days is indispensable; for without
this precaution she would be put to death as
a stranger, or she might escape from the hive
during the first tumult, which would cause the
total failure of the swarm. But after being shut
up in it for a little time, she is looked upon as
the hope of the new colony, and sure of a favourable
reception.</p>

<p>To succeed in this operation, there must be,
at least, six inches between each hive: should
they touch each other, many of the working bees
would infallibly lose their lives, by throwing
themselves into some of the neighbouring ones.</p>

<p>Such is the result of these tedious and difficult
operations to obtain artificial swarms by the
method of M. <span class="smcap">Shirach</span>, at this time generally
pursued in Germany. There is another, easier
and less tedious, said to be in usage in the Archipelago,
in Ancient Greece, and several other
countries, which I have followed with great success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">- 93 -</span></p>

<p>Choose a hive of wood or straw, exactly the
same in form and size of the one from which you
mean to take the swarm. On a fine day in May,
or, in mountainous countries, which are later,
about the beginning of June, throw a few whiffs
of tobacco-smoke into a well-stocked hive, turn
it up, and, with a little more smoke, disperse the
bees that are upon the combs; then cut out a
bit of comb, about the size of the palm of a
hand, taking care that there be the three kinds
of brood, viz. eggs, maggots, and nymphs, already
enclosed in the cells that serve them for
cradles, but especially those maggots that have
been hatched within two days; after returning
this hive to its place, then proceed to fix the bit
of comb with some wooden pins, in the top of
the newly prepared one, and support it underneath
with a thin chip of wood. Between eleven
and twelve in the forenoon, lift a very populous
hive (not the one out of which the brood-comb
was taken), off its own board to another
that must be ready to receive it, and put the
empty one in the place it occupied. All the
bees, returning from the fields, enter the one
that has been substituted, seem at first to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">- 94 -</span>
greatly agitated, but, by degrees, gather round
the brood-comb, and begin before night to construct
a royal cell, to which they transport a
maggot of two days old, and where it undergoes
its metamorphosis, and comes out a queen. By
this method, I have procured excellent swarms
from hives that would not have swarmed naturally;
and, the following spring, renewed the
old hives, after the manner indicated in Chapter XXI,
thus preserving my hives in good condition.</p>

<span class="smaller">ADVANTAGES OF ISOLATED HIVES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">A swarm</span>, taking flight, rushes out of the hive,
and seems bent on fixing itself in some distant
quarter, as if it feared the neighbourhood of
other swarms&mdash;as if it felt that its most formidable
enemies were those of its own kind.</p>

<p>Swarms will unite, however, when they take
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">- 95 -</span>
flight at the same time, because the bees of one
hive cannot be distinguished from those of another
when on the wing, and crossing each other
in every direction; and as soon as one group begins
to knot upon a branch, the bees of the other
crowd round, supposing them to be their companions.
Their instinct, however, rather leads
them to isolate themselves, as they do in great
forests; but their proprietors resist this instinct,
assemble a great many hives together in the same
apiary, to shelter them from the weather, as well
as to protect them from thieves, and to watch
over them at the time of their emigration.</p>

<p>Such are, doubtless, great advantages, but not
sufficient to counterbalance those that would result
from keeping them separate. The mixing
and uniting together of several swarms, that often
take place in large apiaries, and which is
not always an advantage, would thereby be prevented.
There would be greater facility in
forming artificial swarms, and one hive would
not be disturbed in operating on another. The
great expence of bee-houses would thus be spared;
these are much more costly than stands for isolated
hives, for which there is nothing more
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">- 96 -</span>
necessary than a board, supported by a pile of
wood, sunk into the ground, with a thatch of
straw, which any one can spread over the tops
of the hives, to protect them from the rain and
the heat of the sun.</p>

<span class="smaller">ENEMIES OF BEES, AND MEANS OF OVERCOMING THEM.</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">All</span> amateurs that have written on the subject
of bees, have spoken of their enemies, but
few have given any directions in what way they
may be overcome. I should neither attain my
aim, nor realise the title of my work, if I did
not notice them.</p>

<p>Nothing is more prejudicial to bees than ignorant
attention. Their most formidable enemies
are, perhaps, their possessors, who busy
themselves to torment them, and weaken and
kill them by too much care. In winter they hurt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">- 97 -</span>
them, by shutting them up for fear of the snow,
without considering that many more perish in
their unwholesome prison; and that the great
humidity, having no outlet, moulds the combs,
and sometimes even rots them. Who shuts up
the wild bees in the forests of Lithuania, where
they thrive so well? Their own instinct suffices;
there they have no master to thwart them.</p>

<p>In spring, the giving them a little honey, that
would suffice to save them, is not always attended
to, neither is the guarding them from moths,
which at that time make the greatest havoc, nor
is the narrowing of the entrances to prevent
them being robbed. In summer I have seen
persons leave only very small entrances to very
populous hives, even when the bees were forming
clusters, and so increase the ardour and activity
of the workers. But this embarrassment
only pained them, and retarded the gathering
and laying up of their store.</p>

<p>Some let swarms escape from mere carelessness.
People suffocate them in autumn, that
they may possess themselves of their provisions;
and others take out the best of the honey and
often too much of it, and so expose them to die
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">- 98 -</span>
of hunger; and they even sometimes annoy them
by leaving too great a quantity of candied honey-comb,
which is of no use to them, and the
extraction of it from the cells costs many valuable
lives, as I have already observed.</p>

<p>I therefore place, in the foremost rank of their
enemies, those of their <i>possessors</i>, who, by their
own ignorance and inexperience, hinder them
from prospering and multiplying.</p>

<p>Ants are their least dangerous enemies; true,
the bees cannot sting them to death, because
they are small and well defended with armour,
but they seize hold of them with their teeth,
and carry them to a distance. Had they not
this means of getting rid of them, their colonies
could not exist in the vast forests full of ants'
nests, and where they thrive so well, in spite of
the horrible massacres that annually take place.
I have never seen a hive destroyed by ants; they
attack only weak swarms, that have been either
pillaged before, or happen to be established in a
lodging too large for them to defend.</p>

<p>I recommend, however, to plaster up all
chinks through which these little insects could
gain an entrance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">- 99 -</span></p>

<p>Moths are little known, and never injurious,
in the high valleys, nor on the mountains, but
they attack and destroy a vast number of hives
in the plains or in the vineyards, where they are
a great scourge. As soon as a moth has penetrated
a weak hive, it establishes itself in a comb,
envelopes itself in a silken web, multiplies rapidly,
consuming the wax, and spreading its destructive
galleries from side to side, until, arriving
at a certain point, the evil has no remedy.</p>

<p>I shall not repeat what I have said in the
twentieth chapter, of the admirable ingenuity
with which well-stocked hives defend themselves,
by gnawing and reducing to crumbs every part
of the wax that harbours a moth. Nor the means
I have pointed out in <a href="#CHAPTER_VII">Chapter VII.</a> to diminish
the number of their enemies in the spring, by
frequently examining the little bits of wood used
for contracting the entrance, or whenever the
heated air of the hive is likely to attract butterflies,
for the purpose of depositing their eggs.
I shall only add, that when any trace of a moth
is observed about a hive, it should immediately
be cleaned away, and every little fragment of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">- 100 -</span>
wax be swept off the board. If, in defiance of
these precautions, it should seem that the moths
have invaded some of the combs, the only means
of saving the colony is, to imitate the surgeon,
who cuts off a deceased limb to save the other,&mdash;every
bit of infected comb must be cut out,
leaving only those occupied by the bees. And
the bees must then be liberally fed, by giving
them every evening as much honey as will maintain
them until the fields shall yield them a sufficient
quantity. Thus I have preserved hives
whose circumstances seemed to be desperate.</p>

<p>Spiders annoy the bees much. The bees get
entangled in their webs, and are not able to extricate
themselves. Here cleanliness is the best
protection; therefore care should be had to sweep
the webs away from the hive and its avenues
as fast as they appear.</p>

<p>Birds eat a prodigious quantity of bees, especially
in spring, when the trees are in blossom.
Whatever people may say to the contrary, I have
reason to think that the swallows, which are perpetually
cruising about in the air, like so many
corsairs, destroy a great number, to regale themselves,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">- 101 -</span>
and to feed their young: this was the
opinion of <span class="smcap">Virgil</span><a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>.</p>

<p>Moths destroy whole colonies: birds do not
entirely destroy, but they diminish the population;
the queens, especially, become an easy
prey to them, their flight being heavy, from the
great length of their bodies and shortness of
their wings; and the queen, being the very soul
of the hive, when she dies the whole will infallibly
perish, if there is not some of the proper
brood ready to fill her place; and, even in the
latter case, the population is retarded in the fine
weather, and the hive becomes languid. As
this happened to me several times, I imputed it
to the loss of my queens.</p>

<p>The poultry, too, that roam about near the
water where the bees go to quench their thirst,
gobble up a great many of them, making a constant
war on them, as deadly as that carried on by
the birds. I have even seen a tame magpie place
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">- 102 -</span>
herself between two hives, peck right and left,
and snap up hundreds of bees to her breakfast.
She was caught in the act, condemned to death,
and executed in the same instant.</p>

<p>Mice, especially the red mouse, or <i>Sorex araneus</i>,
sometimes penetrate a hive in the winter
time, either from the entrance being left too
wide, or by gnawing a hole for themselves in
the straw. They eat the honey, and even the
bees, when clustered together on the side of the
hive, in which position they are unable to defend
themselves, and scarcely even see the enemy.
I have frequently seen a mouse's nest inside of
a hive in spring, seemingly unperceived by the
inhabitants.</p>

<p>Wasps are also reckoned among the numerous
enemies of bees. I have, however, seldom
seen a hive destroyed by wasps: although they
are larger, stronger, and armed with a formidable
sting, and an impenetrable cuirass, they seldom
dare enter a well stocked hive. Once attacked,
they soon fall beneath the united efforts
of these brave citizens, who sacrifice themselves
to defend the place of their nativity. Wasps
only appear in great numbers when the fruit is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">- 103 -</span>
ripening, and then they range unceasingly round
the hives, and enter the weak ones, or those of
which the too spacious lodging hears no proportion
to the number of its inhabitants. There are
three ways of providing against the attacks of
wasps. The first, is to unite weak hives by
doubling or tripling the population, thereby enabling
them to defend themselves. The second,
is to contract the entrances as soon as the swarming
time is over, after the massacre of the drones:
and the third is, to destroy their nests.</p>

<p>The bees are continually fighting between
themselves, and robbing each other; avarice, not
necessity, leads them to do so, it being almost
always the strongest and best provisioned hives
that pillage the weak ones. When once a bee
has been able to introduce herself into a hive,
and carry away a load of honey without being
arrested, she will return a hundred times the
same day; and, making it known to her companions,
they will then come in hordes, nor cease
their pillage until there is nothing left to take.
In one day the whole of the honey will be carried
off, and with a determination which one can scarcely
have an idea of without seeing it. This kind of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">- 104 -</span>
pillage is most frequent in the spring and autumn,
and it is easier to prevent than to stop it;
and, for this purpose, the entrance of the hives
ought to be straitened in proportion to the population.
Four soldiers, as I have already said,
will more easily guard a narrow pass than thirty
or forty would defend a great one. Whenever
the bees cluster themselves in front of the hive,
it is a proof that the whole of the interior is filled,
and there is then no fear of pillage, excepting in
a very rare case, when they happen not to observe
the thieves, and of which I shall speak
presently. In proportion as the cluster increases,
the entrance should be widened, even opened
entirely, and contracted again in the autumn after
the destruction of the drones. When these
precautions are not sufficient, and the pillage has
commenced, it is not easy to stop it. It may
succeed, however, in spring or autumn, by entirely
closing the entrance of the besieged hive
for one or two days, and putting a large cape
upon it, or an empty hive, plastering it all round
to prevent the bees getting out. This affords them
a volume of air sufficient to prevent them from
being suffocated, and they go up and down at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">- 105 -</span>
pleasure through the hole in the top of the hive
from which the stopper must have been previously
withdrawn; every evening the entrance must
be opened to give them air, and carefully shut
up again in the morning. I have always found
the two days seclusion sufficient to put a stop to
the pillage. But this means is not practicable
during the hot weather, for then the bees would
infallibly be suffocated, if they were to be shut up
but one hour. In this case, I have saved several
by covering them with a wet table-cloth, and
extending it over the front of the hive. The
thieves, who were arriving in hundreds, threw
themselves into the neighbouring hives, where
they were arrested and killed; for all theft, even
suspicion of theft, is invariably punished with
death in these republics. Some of the thieves
that happen to escape, regain their own dwellings,
and warn their companions to beware of
returning, and next day there will be no more
thieving. I have never been obliged to spread
the wet table-cloth a second time. True, many
of the bees of the hive I was defending were sacrificed,
returning from the fields, and being unable
to gain admittance, they perished in some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">- 106 -</span>
way or other: it was a small sacrifice, to avert
a greater evil, but my hive was saved, and that
was my object. It is a cure that does not always
succeed, however, and is quite useless
when the besieged hive is a weak one, or if much
of the honey has been carried away.</p>

<p>I shall not speak of toads, lizards, and all kinds
of reptiles, that are ranked among the enemies
of the bees, for I have never seen that they did
them much harm.</p>

<span class="smaller">DISEASES OF THE BEES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Bees</span> have no real disease. Dysentery, about
which so much noise has been made, and for
which so many remedies are prescribed, never
attacks the bees of a well-stocked hive, that is
left open at all seasons, but only those that are
too long and too closely confined. They are always
in good health as long as they are at liberty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">- 107 -</span>
when they are warm enough, and have plenty
of food. All their pretended diseases are the result
of hunger, cold, or the infection produced
by a too close and long confinement during the
winter.</p>

<p>Some intelligent people have erroneously
thought that the honey gathered from the flowers
of the lime-tree caused dysentery, but experience
convinced me to the contrary; for my hives were
never in better condition than when the lime-tree
flowers supplied them with honey in abundance.</p>

<span class="smaller">OF THE DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF BEES, AND THEIR LANGUAGE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Almost</span> all authors speak of four different
kinds or varieties of the honey-bee. I frankly
acknowledge that I know but of one; and that
all the bees I have seen are equally profitable
when properly taken care of. It is true my travels
have not been very extended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">- 108 -</span></p>

<p>As to their language: a slight buzzing or confused
noise and a sharp sound, are signals by
which they proclaim their danger, or seek assistance
from each other. They appear to have the
power of communicating their desires, their fears,
their situation, and their circumstances. Their
language, or whatever name is given to it, suffices
to procure a concert of wills and actions,
absolutely to attain a certain end; and of which
I shall give a few examples.</p>

<p>When a hive has lost its queen, a general agitation
takes place, that cannot escape the notice
of the most ordinary observer. They seek about
for her on all sides, and, if she cannot be found,
they set to work to supply her place. For this
purpose, a great cell must be constructed, to
serve her for a cradle: a single working bee cannot
manufacture it. There must absolutely be a
concerted plan,&mdash;to choose the place to do the
work&mdash;to transport the newly hatched maggot&mdash;to
nurse it suitably&mdash;and properly to close the
cell when it is to undergo the metamorphosis.</p>

<p>There must also be the same re-union of wills
and efforts, when it relates to the getting rid of
a moth that has established itself in a comb;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">- 109 -</span>
they must ascertain its presence, feel the evil it
may do, examine with care the extent of its galleries,
and agree in the plan of attack and mode
of operations; and how can they form and execute
this plan, without the perfect concurrence
of a great number of labourers? Such agreement
is impossible without some sort of language.</p>

<p>Is the hive to be cleaned? A general assessment
is commanded, and the people instantly
obey. A throng of labourers remove the dead,
carry out the little bits of wax that are on the
board, which would otherwise serve to feed the
moths. Each of these crumbs costs them a journey;
and that toil is spared them when care is
taken to scrape and sweep the board from time
to time.</p>

<p>Another scheme of agreement that indicates
a language, is where a bee finds honey, whether
in a room, where it may have been deposited
without shutting the windows, or in a
stranger hive, where it has gained entrance. It
communicates it to its companions, who rush out
by hundreds or by thousands to obtain a share of
the booty. How could they give this advertisement,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">- 110 -</span>
without a species of language understood
by every one of them.</p>

<span class="smaller">SIGNS OF RECOGNITION AMONG THE BEES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> bees of a hive have the means of recognition,
and of distinguishing their companions
from every stranger bee; without which they
could not defend their honey. In vain would the
Creator have armed each of them with a formidable
sting, had they not been also given to know
the enemies which that sting was to pierce.
Strangers would have gone in and out without
risk of detection or punishment, mingled with
the workers, and deprived them of treasures industriously
collected. But the All-wise Author
of Nature, who has given them the means of defence,
has also endowed them with the instinct
to distinguish enemies from friends, even among
their own species. Let a bee fall by accident,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">- 111 -</span>
or be driven by the wind, into a hive not its own,
it is seized as one suspected of evil intention, and
put to death that moment.</p>

<p>What is their signal of recognition? What is
the organ and the instrument? Is it the antenn&aelig;,&mdash;those
little flexible horns in front of their
heads? or is it by the smell they recognize each
other?</p>

<p>A great inconvenience attending crowded
apiaries is, that two or more hives may have
the same signal; but happily, in this case, which
is a rare one, they have the power of changing
the signal; in proof of which, the following circumstance
happened with mine, in one of the
most abundant honey seasons.</p>

<p>In the month of May I had lodged my first
swarm, which was a very strong one, in a large
straw hive. The weather being very mild, they
set to work immediately, and very soon filled
more than half of the hive. In a few days, I
observed it was invaded by a swarm belonging
to one of my neighbours; that they went in and
came out, without being detected; and that they
were carrying out as much honey as my bees
were bringing in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">- 112 -</span></p>

<p>I shut up one-half of their door; and, for nearly
a whole week, whenever I was at leisure, I
stationed myself near my swarm, and killed every
day hundreds of the thieves, which were easily
distinguished by their shape,&mdash;slender enough
when they went in, but puffed up as they came
out, with as much nectar as they could contain.
This, however, did not stop them, and they continued
coming and going, in greater numbers,
till night, and beginning again early in the morning.</p>

<p>I had plenty of sport, but my labour was in
vain, and I began to despair of saving my swarm,
when, one afternoon, I perceived it to be agitated
and troubled, as if it had lost its queen.
The bees buzzed about before the hive, and on
the board, smelling and touching each other, as
if they would have spoken. It was to change
their signal, and which in fact they did change,
during the night; and all the strangers that came
next day were arrested, and put to death. Some
escaped the vigilance of the guards that defended
the entrance, and doubtless warned the others of
the danger they had escaped, and that they could
no more plunder with impunity: they returned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">- 113 -</span>
no more, and my hive prospered wonderfully. I
have, in the course of my life, seen only other
two similar instances that had the same result.</p>

<span class="smaller">PRESERVATION OF HIVES IN WINTER, AND MEANS
OF PROTECTING THEM FROM THE COLD.</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> most important point that remains to be
treated, is the preservation of hives in winter.
This severe season, which lasts at Neufchatel four
months, from the commencement of November
to the end of February, and which is even longer
in the mountains, causes the death of more bees
than all the enemies of all the other seasons put
together; and mostly, too, from our own want of
attention. It is by practice only that true principles
can be laid down: and these principles
must be variously modified, to adapt their application
to the differences of temperature and locality.
One can learn with certainty only by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">- 114 -</span>
light of experience. I shall proceed to tell what
it has taught me; and here I enter on the most
difficult and the most essential part of my task.</p>

<p>We must suppose that the necessary care
has been taken to ascertain that each hive has
the quantity of provision necessary for its subsistence
until the return of the fine season, and
it is better that they should have too much than
too little; for bees are great economists, and
never waste their superfluity.</p>

<p>I lay down as a general rule, and without any
exception, that bees ought never to be fed during
the winter. Food given them during that season
causes disease, breeds infection, particularly
if they are kept confined; and if they are at liberty,
and forced out by the unwholesome smell
of the hive, they are likely to perish from the
cold. Besides, it always appeared to me that
they consume more when food is given them by
little and little, than when they have it in store.
I have pointed out, in <a href="#CHAPTER_VIII">Chapter VIII.</a> the certain
rule by which the quantity of provision may be
estimated; and, in <a href="#CHAPTER_XVII">Chapter XVII.</a> I have detailed
the method of supplying them in autumn. Thus
they will be saved from hunger, if my advice be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">- 115 -</span>
followed. Let us now see how they may be defended
from cold, and the fatal effects of a long
imprisonment. Some winters are so long and so
rigid, that our valuable insects suffer greatly
from the intensity of the cold; and the least evil
it does them, is to crystallise their honey, which
is then no longer of any use to them. The
warmth keeps it in a fluid state; but this warmth,
concentrated in the middle, or on one side of the
hive, does not prevent it being candied in the
other parts of it. More candied honey will generally
be found on one side than the other.
This may be prevented by narrowing the entrance,
and closing up every crevice by which
the external air can penetrate. Our industrious
and provident little labourers set the example.
Their instinct leads them, during the summer,
carefully to close up every crack or joining of
their habitation, with a sort of gummy matter
called <i>propolis</i>, which cannot be penetrated either
by the mice, the moths, or the ants. I have seen
an excellent swarm perish, in consequence of a
slight bend in the board, which left an interstice
on each side, through which a cold north
wind sifted, and froze more than three-fourths
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">- 116 -</span>
of the bees; and no after care was able to save
those that were left.</p>

<p>Two years after, another hive, belonging to
the same person, carefully plastered round, but
being made of too slight material, too thin, and
having no covering, lost at least two-thirds of its
population from cold. It was saved, however,
by great care, and in time recovered. It is to
avoid similar disasters that hives are commonly
taken into the house; but this exposes them to
the evil arising from infection.</p>

<p>A thick strong-made hive is a more certain
protection from the cold than one that is thin
and light. It keeps in the warmth, like suitable
winter clothing; while the other resembles an
unseasonable summer garment: and, for this reason,
I have recommended, in <a href="#CHAPTER_VI">Chapter VI.</a> not to
spare the <i>material</i>. Notwithstanding the excessive
cold of Lithuania, and the north of Russia,
the swarms succeed in finding for themselves a
comfortable abode in the hollows of the thick
oak-trees, through which the cold does not penetrate.
But, in addition to the warmth arising
from the thickness of the hive, I always cover
mine, during severe weather, with a piece of old
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">- 117 -</span>
blanket, or some such thing, to check the first
impression of the cold; and as few country people
have a thermometer, by which to estimate
the degree of temperature, they should hasten to
thatch, or cover them, in some way, whenever
they perceive the hoar frost on the glass of their
windows, which will be the case when the common
thermometer of Fahrenheit descends three
or four degrees below the freezing point.</p>

<span class="smaller">MANNER OF PRESERVING HIVES BY TAKING THEM
INTO THE HOUSE IN WINTER.</span></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is generally supposed that, in the high valleys,
and in the mountains, bees can only be preserved
by taking the hives into the house in
winter, where they must remain, until the snow
has disappeared, before they can be set at liberty.
I had this fatal prejudice for many years; but it
was dispelled by the success attending the union
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">- 118 -</span>
of the five swarms of which I have given a detailed
account in <a href="#CHAPTER_XVIII">Chapter XVIII.</a>, at which time
a ray of light broke in upon me that has since
continued to guide me.</p>

<p>The following winter I left out the one-half
of my hives, and moved the other half into a
cold room, according to my usual custom, where
all the pains I bestowed upon them did not altogether
keep them alive, nor preserve them from
damp and infection. In vain I swept and cleaned
the boards, or placed them on dry hay to absorb
the moisture; in vain I gave them capes or joinings.
With all my care, there was not one of
them free of diseases and infection. The winter
was long and severe; and they could not be returned
to the air before the last week in March,
by which time they were feeble and languid, and
far less prosperous than those that had passed
the winter out of doors. From that time, I have
never taken one into the house. But, as hives
that have been weakened by giving out too many
swarms, especially swarms of the same year, that
have not nearly filled the interior of their habitation
with combs, are less subject to become
overheated, and to mould, than those that are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">- 119 -</span>
quite filled, and of which the population is very
strong, the inhabitants of the mountains might
have the latter in the open air all winter, and
only move the others into the house. They will
find, as I have done, that strong well filled hives
are far best out of doors, provided they take
the necessary precautions to prevent them from
freezing.</p>

<p>I have somewhere or other read an account of
a very ingenious method of preserving hives in
winter, but have not made trial of it, in consequence
of not having a place fitting for it. According
to this plan, one must have an empty
room, very cold and dry, in which, from end to
end, two long poles are suspended parallel to
each other, and a foot of distance between them.
As soon as the severe cold begins, and the thermometer
is at the freezing point, the hives are
all moved into this room, and set up upon the
poles, without any board beneath them, and separate
about half a foot from each other. Each
hive must be numbered, and the numbers noted
down, as well as the board and place that each
occupied in the apiary, in order that they may
be replaced in exactly the same situation on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">- 120 -</span>
return of spring. This done, the room is darkened,
as the smallest ray of light will induce the
bees to quit their hives; and, in this manner,
they may be preserved in a healthy state, and
without diminution of their numbers, during the
winter; and, from being left entirely open below,
any dead bees, or bits of wax, fall on the
floor, and they escape the danger of infection.</p>

<p>On the return of the fine season, and early in
the morning of a calm day, the room is opened,
and each hive returned to its own place on the
apiary.</p>

<p>I have reason to think that hives, wintered in
this way, will consume a quarter, a third, or perhaps
one-half less provision than others, if left
on the apiary, or shut up entirely from the air;
but we must attend less to the rigid economy of
the honey, than to the preservation of the valuable
insects that collect it for us.</p>

<p>I possess only the theory of a practice of which
I should have gloried in being the inventor, as it
appears to me infallible, and advantageous in all
its relations, but more especially to the inhabitants
of the mountains. There two or three people
might hire a room among them for the purpose;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">- 121 -</span>
and, should the air become impure from
so many hives being closed up together, it could
be purified by opening the door during the night,
and closing it well up again in the morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> now given the result of sixty-four years
experience. This little memoir has extended beneath
my pen far beyond my original intention;
but it was of consequence in describing the new
methods I had adopted, to give my reasons for
every thing I recommended; and, for this purpose,
to enter very minutely into the details. I
have not written with elegance, but have expressed
myself plainly; and, in giving the account
of my experiments, it seemed to me that,
to be clearly understood, I ought to relate naturally
how I set about them, as the different circumstances
occurred, and that every reader could
more easily follow me, in seeing me <i>act</i>, as it
were, than if I merely laid down general rules.
Those I have given, have the rare advantage of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">- 122 -</span>
being applicable to every kind of hive, of wood
or straw, whether large or small, and of whatever
form or shape. I have not recommended
any one kind in particular, not even those that
bear my name, as I consider them all equally
profitable when skilfully taken care of. Every
one may make use of such as he likes best, or
such as he can most easily procure. I wish not
to lead the apiarian into any expence, but to
point out to him clearly those principles and
rules that he should not lose sight of, if he wishes
to preserve his bees and to profit by them.</p>

<p>If this little work is favourably received by
the public, and if my life is spared, I may be induced
to give it a sequel, in which will be found
new ideas concerning the drones, and their destination,
with several experiments to discover if
it is of any use to assist the bees in killing them;
calculations of the yearly and average profit of a
single hive, by which I would encourage the cultivators
to work a rich mine whence great profit
maybe drawn; and also directions for purifying
the honey, as well as for melting the wax,
none of which could have a place in this little
book, the sole object, as expressed in the title,
being the <i>preservation of the bees</i>.</p>

<p>To know exactly if the consumption of united
hives was greater than that of those hives whose
population had not been augmented, I weighed
thirty-six hives on the 31st of March 1814, that
had been previously weighed on the 20th September
1813; but I omitted those from which I
had taken honey, as well as those I fed, as I did
not weigh them. It may be observed, by the
foregoing table, that the most economical expenditure
amounts to eight pounds of honey, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">- 125 -</span>
that the greatest consumption is nineteen. I
can attribute this enormous difference to nothing
but pillage. It is very likely that the
straw-hive, No. 38., must have enriched itself
with booty in October or in March, while the
wooden hive No. 8. had been plundered. Of
these thirty-six hives, six had been doubled in
October, by the introduction of a strong swarm
into each of them, and we see that their expenditure
has not been greater than that of those
colonies that were left single. In the course of
six months and eleven days, one diminished only
eight pounds and a half; one, nine and a half;
one, ten and a half; one eleven; one, eleven
and a half; and the least economical, fourteen
pounds. This comparison demonstrates, that
hives, doubled by the re-union of the bees of
another hive, consume no more in winter than
less populous hives, left in their natural state.
The fact is clearly proved, though I am ignorant
of the cause. I ought to observe, that all these
doubled hives, with the exception of one old one,
twenty-two years of age, prospered perfectly the
year following, and gave me more honey and
more swarms than all the others.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="NOTE_BY_THE_TRANSLATOR">NOTE BY THE TRANSLATOR.</h2>
</div>


<p>Some friends, for whom I entertain a very
high respect, have remarked, on reading the proof
sheets of this translation, that <span class="smcap">Gelieu</span> appears
to be very successful in preserving the bees, but
that he does not prove so clearly that any great
increase of honey is thereby to be obtained. To
the practical apiarian this objection will never
present itself; but, for the satisfaction of those
who are not acquainted with bees, I regret not
being in possession of <span class="smcap">Gelieu's</span> calculation of
the average profits of single and doubled hives:
and I regret more especially, that, during the
few years my attention has been directed to the
management of bees, I have been contented with
remarking the thriving condition of the apiary,
without giving myself the trouble to calculate the
exact amount of its produce. Those, however,
who are accustomed to observe and to take care of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">- 127 -</span>
bees, will know that the whole value of the hives
depends on the swarms being large and early,
and will therefore see at once the advantages
to be gained by attending to <span class="smcap">Gelieu's</span> directions.
The results of my own experience are, in other
respects, as follows.</p>

<p>I have tried hives of various kinds: those of
the common shape, made of straw; the still
prettier sort, made of sea-shore bent (<i>Arundo
arenaria</i>); the square-storied hive of wood;
also the Huish hives; and, consequently, have
had an opportunity of assuring myself that the
success of the apiary depends neither on the
form nor the material, but entirely on the treatment
the bees meet with, and that hives may
be made, with equal success, of whatever is most
easily obtained in the district they are to be
used in, always provided they are kept clean
and are well managed. In some of the high valleys
of the Alps, where straw is not to be had,
and where every blade of grass is carefully economized
for the use of the cattle, the hives are
merely rough blocks of timber, sawn across the
stems of the pine tree, and rudely scooped out
to receive the swarms: these answer the purpose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">- 128 -</span>
just as well as other hives; and the only
or the chief difference, is the greater or less facilities
which each affords for the extraction of the
combs; an operation of easy performance in the
Huish hives, when its inventor's directions are
adhered to. But, in Switzerland, the same process
is accomplished without difficulty in hives
of any shape or material, by means of a knife,
which is so simple in its construction, and so
easily used, that it deserves to be made generally
known. I therefore subjoin a figure, with a
description and a note of the dimensions, from
which it may be made by any country black-smith.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig_4" style="width: 353px;">
  <img src="images/fig_4.png" width="353" height="60" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This figure represents the shape of the knife;
it is formed merely of a slip of iron, about
two feet long by an eighth of an inch thick.
The two horizontal lines <i>a a</i> shew the size and
appearance of the handle, which is twenty inches
long by half an inch broad. The turned-down
blade (<i>b</i>), of two inches in length, is spear-pointed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">- 129 -</span>
sharp on the edges, and bent perpendicularly
from the handle. The other blade (<i>c</i>) is
two inches long by one and a half broad, and
sharpened all round, as marked by the double
black line.</p>

<p>The broad blade (<i>c</i>) cuts and separates the
wax from the sides of the hive, and the spear-point
(<i>b</i>), which is also sharp on each side, admits,
from its direction and narrowness, of being
introduced between the combs, to loosen them
from the top of the hive; and, for the same reason,
it also answers the purpose of pruning the
combs.</p>

<p>The honey-comb which is thus extracted, or
which is obtained from the capes, is greatly
superior to that which is suffered to remain in
the hives till the autumn. The wax is thin and
transparent, and the honey, being newly drawn
from the nectaries, is particularly rich and delicious,
as it has not had time to lose the fragrant
and delicate flavour of the young flowers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Huish</span>, it may be observed, gives very clear
directions for extracting the combs from the
hives that bear his name; he also recommends
the uniting of swarms; but I could never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">- 130 -</span>
obtain his instructions on this latter point.
Doubting nothing of its practicability, however,
I made the experiment, but having no guiding
principle to direct me, it was like going to sea
without a compass; and, in consequence, my
hopes were soon wrecked, and I had the misery
of seeing the whole of the swarm that I had
saved from suffocation, speedily put to death
by the bees of the hive that I had so rashly
forced it to enter. The result, however, was
widely different when I made the trial again last
autumn, guided by the directions contained in
this little volume, for I accomplished the union
of my swarms without difficulty&mdash;even without
previously having seen it done, and without having
received a single sting; and I had thus the
pleasure of witnessing my hopes crowned with
complete success.</p>

<p>For this operation, it is not necessary either to
have the courage of a warrior, or the intelligence
and coolness of a philosopher like M. <span class="smcap">de Gelieu</span>.
An ordinary degree of judgment to understand
his directions, and confidence enough implicitly
to follow them, will enable any one to perform
it, provided he sets about it cautiously, and takes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">- 131 -</span>
care not to hurt the bees, or to handle them
roughly.</p>

<p>I managed It, with the assistance of two persons,
without gloves, or any shield or shadow of
defence, except a little tobacco-smoke, involving
us, as it were, within the influence of a charmed
atmosphere, that seemed to stupify the bees, and
render their sting powerless, while it inspired us
with confidence to proceed. I recommend it
being done at first by three persons, one to manage
the hive and extract the combs, another to
sweep the bees back gently with a feather or
goose-wing, and a third to manage the fumigating
bellows; or, if the fumigating-bellows are
not at hand, to blow occasional whiffs of smoke
from a tobacco-pipe.</p>

<p>When my first cluster of bees was shaken out
of the pillaged hive upon the table-cloth, I had
the happiness of seeing them instantly begin
their ascent (not on the wing) but in a regular
march. It was a spectacle of intense interest.
They entered the full hive as orderly and as
peaceably as any body of regular troops ever
took possession of a citadel; and next day the
original possessors and the new settlers, were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">- 132 -</span>
seen, in perfect harmony, working together for
the general good.</p>

<p>But whether they thought proper to kill a
queen for themselves or not, was a fact that I
had no means to ascertain.</p>

<p>Thus encouraged by my first experiment, I
proceeded to extend it. My whole apiary consisted
of eight Huish hives, isolated on single
pillars of wood, at the distance of three feet from
each other. We emptied three more of the
hives, and joined a swarm to each of the remaining
three, making four doubled stock hives.
The gardener who has the care of them, had
five hives of his own, three of which were deprived
of their honey in the same way, and
the swarms joined to the remaining two, which
he had kept as stock hives; and I am now enabled
to state exactly the quantity of honey that
each has consumed from September 1828, to the
end of March 1829.</p>

<p>It ought, however, to be mentioned, that my
four hives got a pound and a half of honey
among them, in February; but those belonging
to the gardener got no feeding. The entrances
of all of them were left open during the winter,
and there were not altogether above two dozen
dead bees found on the boards, when they were
lifted to be weighed.</p>

<p>The gardener's hive. No. 2., received two
swarms in addition to its own; and this allied
army took possession just as peaceably as the
others, and actually consumed less honey during
the winter than No. 1., which was only doubled.
In effecting the union, the citizens had been plentifully
regaled with a sprinkling of liquid honey,
previous to the introduction of the strangers;
and there were as many luscious drops of the
banquet left, as gave the new comers no disrelish
to their quarters.</p>

<p>For some years past, I have suffered no sticks
to be put across the inside of any of my hives,
as they render the extraction of the combs impracticable.</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
